Every day at eight in the morning he was brought his breakfast by  Mrs Grubach's cook - Mrs Grubach was his landlady - but today she didn't come.
That had never happened before.
K waited a little while, looked from his pillow at the old woman who lived opposite and who was watching him with an inquisitiveness quite unusual for her, and finally, both hungry and disconcerted, rang the bell.
There was immediately a knock at the door and a man entered.
He had never seen the man in this house before.
He was slim but firmly built, his clothes were black and close-fitting, with many folds and pockets, buckles and buttons and a belt, all of which gave the impression of being very practical but without making it very clear what they were actually for.
He still had time.
Allow me, he said, and hurried between the two policemen through into his room.
He seems sensible enough, he heard them say behind him.
Once in his room, he quickly pulled open the drawer of his writing desk, everything in it was very tidy but in his agitation he was unable to find the identification documents he was looking for straight away.
He finally found his bicycle permit and was about to go back to the policemen with it when it seemed to him too petty, so he carried on searching until he found his birth certificate.
He only saw her for an instant, for as soon as she recognised K she was clearly embarrassed, asked for forgiveness and disappeared, closing the door behind her very carefully.
Do come in, K could have said just then.
But now he stood in the middle of the room with his papers in his hand and still looking at the door which did not open again.
He stayed like that until he was startled out of it by the shout of the policeman who sat at the little table at the open window and, as K now saw, was eating his breakfast.
Without giving any answer to this offer, K stood still for some time.
Perhaps, if he opened the door of the next room or even the front door, the two of them would not dare to stand in his way, perhaps that would be the simplest way to settle the whole thing, by bringing it to a head.
But maybe they would grab him, and if he were thrown down on the ground he would lose all the advantage he, in a certain respect, had over them.
So he decided on the more certain solution, the way things would go in the natural course of events, and went back in his room without another word either from him or from the policemen.
He threw himself down on his bed, and from the dressing table he took the nice apple that he had put there the previous evening for his breakfast.
Now it was all the breakfast he had and anyway, as he confirmed as soon as he took his first, big bite of it, it was far better than a breakfast he could have had through the good will of the policemen from the dirty café.
He felt well and confident, he had failed to go into work at the bank this morning but that could easily be excused because of the relatively high position he held there.
Should he really send in his explanation?
He wondered about it.
If nobody believed him, and in this case that would be understandable, he could bring Mrs Grubach in as a witness, or even the old pair from across the street, who probably even now were on their way over to the window opposite.
It puzzled K, at least it puzzled him looking at it from the policemen's point of view, that they had made him go into the room and left him alone there, where he had ten different ways of killing himself.
At the same time, though, he asked himself, this time looking at it from his own point of view, what reason he could have to do so.
It would have been so pointless to kill himself that, even if he had wanted to, the pointlessness would have made him unable.
Maybe, if the policemen had not been so obviously limited in their mental abilities, it could have been supposed that they had come to the same conclusion and saw no danger in leaving him alone because of it.
They could watch now, if they wanted, and see how he went over to the cupboard in the wall where he kept a bottle of good schnapps, how he first emptied a glass of it in place of his breakfast and how he then took a second glassful in order to give himself courage, the last one just as a precaution for the unlikely chance it would be needed.
Once he was properly dressed, K had to pass by Willem as he went through the next room into the one beyond, the door of which was already wide open.
She was in the habit of going out to work very early and coming back home very late, and K had never exchanged more than a few words of greeting with her.
Now, her bedside table had been pulled into the middle of the room to be used as a desk for these proceedings, and the supervisor sat behind it.
He had his legs crossed, and had thrown one arm over the backrest of the chair.
In one corner of the room there were three young people looking at the photographs belonging to Miss Bürstner that had been put into a piece of fabric on the wall.
Hung up on the handle of the open window was a white blouse.
At the window across the street, there was the old pair again, although now their number had increased, as behind them, and far taller than they were, stood a man with an open shirt that showed his chest and a reddish goatee beard which he squeezed and twisted with his fingers.
K stared at the supervisor.
Was this man, probably younger than he was, lecturing him like a schoolmaster?
Was he being punished for his honesty with a telling off?
He became somewhat cross and began to walk up and down.
No-one stopped him doing this and he pushed his sleeves back, felt his chest, straightened his hair,  went over to the three men, said, It makes no sense, at which these three turned round to face him and came towards him with serious expressions.
He finally came again to a halt in front of the supervisor's desk.
State Attorney Hasterer is a good friend of mine, he said, can I telephone him?
Certainly, said the supervisor, but I don't know what the point of that will be, I suppose you must have some private matter you want to discuss with him.
What the point is?
shouted K, more disconcerted that cross.
Who do you think you are?
It's enough to make you cry!
Very well, I won't make the telephone call.
You can call him if you want to, said the supervisor, stretching his hand out towards the outer room where the telephone was, please, go on, do make your phone call.
No, I don't want to any more, said K, and went over to the window.
Across the street, the people were still there at the window, and it was only now that K had gone up to his window that they seemed to become uneasy about quietly watching what was going on.
The old couple wanted to get up but the man behind them calmed them down.
We've got some kind of audience over there, called K to the supervisor, quite loudly, as he pointed out with his forefinger.
Go away, he then called across to them.
And the three of them did immediately retreat a few steps, the old pair even found themselves behind the man who then concealed them with the breadth of his body and seemed, going by the movements of his mouth, to be saying something incomprehensible into the distance.
They did not disappear entirely, though, but seemed to be waiting for the moment when they could come back to the window without being noticed.
That spring, whenever possible, K usually spent his evenings after work - he usually stayed in the office until nine o'clock - with a short walk, either by himself or in the company of some of the bank officials, and then he would go into a pub where he would sit at the regulars' table with mostly older men until eleven.
There were, however, also exceptions to this habit, times, for instance, when K was invited by the bank's manager (whom he greatly respected for his industry and trustworthiness) to go with him for a ride in his car or to eat dinner with him at his large house.
K would also go, once a week, to see a girl called Elsa who worked as a waitress in a wine bar through the night until late in the morning.
During the daytime she only received visitors while still in bed.
That evening, though, - the day had passed quickly with a lot of hard work and many respectful and friendly birthday greetings - K wanted to go straight home.
Each time he had any small break from the day's work he considered, without knowing exactly what he had in mind, that Mrs Grubach's flat seemed to have been put into great disarray by the events of that morning, and that it was up to him to put it back into order.
Once order had been restored, every trace of those events would have been erased and everything would take its previous course once more.
In particular, there was nothing to fear from the three bank officials, they had immersed themselves back into their paperwork and there was no alteration to be seen in them.
K had called each of them, separately or all together, into his office that day for no other reason than to observe them; he was always satisfied and had always been able to let them go again.
At half past nine that evening, when he arrived back in front of the building where he lived, he met a young lad in the doorway who was standing there, his legs apart and smoking a pipe.
Who are you?
He could have gone directly to his room, but as he wanted to speak with Mrs Grubach he went straight to her door and knocked.
K apologised, a little embarrassed at coming so late, but Mrs Grubach was very friendly and did not want to hear any apology, she was always ready to speak to him, he knew very well that he was her best and her favourite tenant.
K looked round the room, it looked exactly as it usually did, the breakfast dishes, which had been on the table by the window that morning, had already been cleared away.
A woman's hands will do many things when no-one's looking, he thought, he might himself have smashed all the dishes on the spot but certainly would not have been able to carry it all out.
He looked at Mrs Grubach with some gratitude.
There's nothing stupid about what you've said, Mrs Grubach, or at least I partly agree with you, only, the way I judge the whole thing is harsher than yours, and think it's not only not something complicated but simply a fuss about nothing.
I was just caught unawares, that's what happened.
If I had got up as soon as I was awake without letting myself get confused because Anna wasn't there, if I'd got up and paid no regard to anyone who might have been in my way and come straight to you, if I'd done something like having my breakfast in the kitchen as an exception, asked you to bring my clothes from my room, in short, if I had behaved sensibly then nothing more would have happened, everything that was waiting to happen would have been stifled.
People are so often unprepared.
In the bank, for example, I am well prepared, nothing of this sort could possibly happen to me there, I have my own assistant there, there are telephones for internal and external calls in front of me on the desk, I continually receive visits from people, representatives, officials, but besides that, and most importantly, I'm always occupied with my work, that's to say I'm always alert, it would even be a pleasure for me to find myself faced with something of that sort.
But now it's over with, and I didn't really even want to talk about it any more, only I wanted to hear what you, as a sensible woman, thought about it all, and I'm very glad to hear that we're in agreement.
Will she shake hands with me?
She stood up, as he had also stood up, and was a little self- conscious, she hadn't been able to understand everything that K said.
As a result of this self consciousness she said something that she certainly did not intend and certainly was not appropriate.
I didn't know I was taking it hard, said K, feeling suddenly tired and seeing that if this woman did agree with him it was of very little value.
Before going out the door he asked, Is Miss Bürstner home?
She's at the theatre.
Did you want to see her?
Should I give her a message?
I, er, I just wanted to have a few words with her.
It really doesn't matter, said K his head hanging as he turned to the door to leave, I just wanted to give her my apology for taking over her room today.
There's no need for that, Mr K, you're too conscientious, the young lady doesn't know anything about it, she hasn't been home since early this morning and everything's been tidied up again, you can see for yourself.
And she opened the door to Miss Bürstner's room.
The moon shone quietly into the unlit room.
He did not feel at all like going to bed, so he decided to stay up, and this would also give him the chance to find out when Miss Bürstner would arrive home.
As he lay there by the window, pressing his hands to his tired eyes, he even thought for a moment that he might punish Mrs Grubach by persuading Miss Bürstner to give in her notice at the same time as he would.
But he immediately realised that that would be shockingly excessive, and there would even be the suspicion that he was moving house because of the incidents of that morning.
When he had become tired of looking out onto the empty street he slightly opened the door to the living room so that he could see anyone who entered the flat from where he was and lay down on the couch.
He lay there, quietly smoking a cigar, until about eleven o'clock.
He wasn't able to hold out longer than that, and went a little way into the hallway as if in that way he could make Miss Bürstner arrive sooner.
He had no particular desire for her, he could not even remember what she looked like, but now he wanted to speak to her and it irritated him that her late arrival home meant this day would be full of unease and disorder right to its very end.
It was also her fault that he had not had any dinner that evening and that he had been unable to visit Elsa as he had intended.
He wanted to do so even later, after the discussion with Miss Bürstner.
K, who had been lost in his thoughts in the hallway, walking up and down loudly as if it were his own room, fled behind his door.
Miss Bürstner had arrived.
The next moment she would certainly go into her room, where K ought not to intrude in the middle of the night; that meant he would have to speak to her now, but, unfortunately, he had not put the electric light on in his room so that when he stepped out of the dark it would give the impression of being an attack and would certainly, at the very least, have been quite alarming.
It sounded like he was pleading with her, not calling to her.
Miss Bürstner went pale and laid her hand on her heart.
K was especially startled, as for a moment he had been quite unable to think of anything other than the events of that morning and the girl for whom he was performing them.
Don't be afraid, he whispered, I'll put everything right.
But who can it be?
It's only the living room next door, nobody sleeps in there.
Yes they do, whispered Miss Bürstner into K's ear, a nephew of Mrs Grubach's, an captain in the army, has been sleeping there since yesterday.
There's no other room free.
I'd forgotten about it too.
Why did you have to shout like that?
You've made me quite upset.
Go away, go away, she said, hurriedly sitting back up, get out of here, go, what is it you want, he's listening at the door he can hear everything.
You're causing me so much trouble!
I won't go, said K, until you've calmed down a bit.
Come over into the other corner of the room, he won't be able to hear us there.
She let him lead her there.
You know how much esteem Mrs Grubach has for  me, she's the one who will make all the decisions in this, especially as the captain is her nephew, but she believes everything I say without question.
I will confirm whatever you say to explain our being here together, however inappropriate it might be, and I guarantee to make sure that Mrs Grubach will not only say she believes the explanation in public but will believe it truly and sincerely.
You will have no need to consider me in any way.
If you wish to let it be known that I have attacked you then Mrs Grubach will be informed of such and she will believe it without even losing her trust in me, that's how much respect she has for me.
He was made aware that these cross examinations would follow one another regularly, perhaps not every week but quite frequently.
On the one hand it was in everyone's interest to bring proceedings quickly to their conclusion, but on the other hand every aspect of the examinations had to be carried out thoroughly without lasting too long because of the associated stress.
It was assumed that he would be in agreement with this, but if he wished for another date then, as far as possible, he would be accommodated.
Anyway, as long as K made no objection, the hearing would be left on Sundays.
It was a matter of course that he would have to appear without fail, there was probably no need to point this out to him.
He would be given the number of the building where he was to present himself, which was in a street in a suburb well away from the city centre which K had never been to before.
Once he had received this notice, K hung up the receiver without giving an answer; he had decided immediately to go there that Sunday, it was certainly necessary, proceedings had begun and he had to face up to it, and this first examination would probably also be the last.
He was still standing in thought by the telephone when he heard the voice of the deputy director behind him - he wanted to use the telephone but K stood in his way.
The weather was dull on Sunday.
K was very tired, as he had stayed out drinking until late in the night celebrating with some of the regulars, and he had almost overslept.
With no breakfast, he rushed to the suburb he had been told about.
Oddly enough, although he had little time to look around him, he came across the three bank officials involved in his case, Rabensteiner, Kullich and Kaminer.
The first two were travelling in a tram that went across K's route, but Kaminer sat on the terrace of a café and leant curiously over the wall as K came over.
All of them seemed to be looking at him, surprised at seeing their superior running; it was  a kind of pride that made K want to go on foot, this was his affair and the idea of any help from strangers, however slight, was repulsive to him, he also wanted to avoid asking for anyone's help because that would initiate them into the affair even if only slightly.
Anyway, now he was running so that he would get there by nine o'clock if at all possible, even though he had no appointment for this time.
He had thought that he would recognise the building from a distance by some kind of sign, without knowing exactly what the sign would look like, or from some particular kind of activity outside the entrance.
K had been told that the building was in Juliusstrasse, but when he stood at the street's entrance it consisted on each side of almost nothing but monotonous, grey constructions, tall blocks of flats occupied by poor people.
Now, on  a Sunday morning, most of the windows were occupied, men in their shirtsleeves leant out smoking, or carefully and gently held small children on the sills.
It was a long street, and spaced evenly along it were small shops below street level, selling various kinds of foodstuffs, which you reached by going down a few steps.
Women went in and out of them or stood chatting on the steps.
A fruitmonger, taking his goods up to the windows, was just as inattentive as K and nearly knocked him down with his cart.
Just then, a gramophone, which in better parts of town would have been seen as worn out, began to play some murderous tune.
K went further into the street, slowly, as if he had plenty of time now, or as if the examining magistrate were looking at him from one of the windows and therefore knew that K had found his way there.
It was shortly after nine.
The building was quite far down the street, it covered so much area it was almost extraordinary, and the gateway in particular was tall and long.
It was clearly intended for delivery wagons belonging to the various warehouses all round the yard which were now locked up and carried the names of companies some of which K knew from his work at the bank.
In contrast with his usual habits, he remained standing a while at the entrance to the yard taking in all these external details.
There were two lads swinging on a hand cart.
In front of a pump stood a weak, young girl in a bedjacket who, as the water flowed into her can, looked at K  There was a piece of rope stretched between two windows in a corner of the yard, with some washing hanging on it to dry.
A man stood below it calling out instructions to direct the work being done.
K went over to the stairway to get to the room where the hearing was to take place, but then stood still again as besides these steps he could see three other stairway entrances, and there also seemed to be a small passageway at the end of the yard leading into a second yard.
It irritated him that he had not been given more precise directions to the room, it meant they were either being especially neglectful with him or especially indifferent, and he decided to make that clear to them very loudly and very unambiguously.
In the end he decided to climb up the stairs, his thoughts playing on something that he remembered the policeman, Willem, saying to him; that the court is attracted by the guilt, from which it followed that the courtroom must be on the stairway that K selected by chance.
As he went up he disturbed a large group of children playing on the stairs who looked at him as he stepped through their rows.
Next time I come here, he said to himself, I must either bring sweets with me to make them like me or a stick to hit them with.
Just before he reached the first landing he even had to wait a little while until a ball had finished its movement, two small lads with sly faces like grown-up scoundrels held him by his trouser-legs until it had; if he were to shake them off he would have to hurt them, and he was afraid of what noise they would make by shouting.
On the first floor, his search began for real.
He still felt unable to ask for the investigating committee, and so he invented a joiner called Lanz - that name occurred to him because the captain, Mrs Grubach's nephew, was called Lanz - so that he could ask at every flat whether Lanz the joiner lived there and thus obtain a chance to look into the rooms.
It turned out, though, that that was mostly possible without further ado, as almost all the doors were left open and the children ran in and out.
Most of them were small, one-windowed rooms where they also did the cooking.
Many women held babies in one arm and worked at the stove with the other.
In every room, the beds were still in use by people who were ill, or still asleep, or people stretched out on them in their clothes.
It was usually a woman who opened the door, heard the enquiry and turned to somebody in the room who would raise himself from the bed.
The gentleman's asking if a joiner called Lanz, lives here.
K thought he had stepped into a meeting.
A medium sized, two windowed room was filled with the most diverse crowd of people - nobody paid any attention to the person who had just entered.
Close under its ceiling it was surrounded by a gallery which was also fully occupied and where the people could only stand bent down with their heads and their backs touching the ceiling.
K, who found the air too stuffy, stepped out again and said to the young woman, who had probably misunderstood what he had said, I asked for a joiner, someone by the name of Lanz.
Yes, said the woman, please go on in.
K would probably not have followed her if the woman had not gone up to him, taken hold of the door handle and said, I'll have to close the door after you, no-one else will be allowed in.
Very sensible, said K, but it's too full already.
But then he went back in anyway.
He passed through between two men who were talking beside the door - one of them held both hands far out in front of himself making the movements of counting out money, the other looked him closely in the eyes - and someone took him by the hand.
It was a small, red-faced youth.
Come in, come in, he said.
K let himself be led by him, and it turned out that there was - surprisingly in a densely packed crowd of people moving to and fro - a narrow passage which may have been the division between two factions; this idea was reinforced by the fact that in the first few rows to the left and the right of him there was hardly any face looking in his direction, he saw nothing but the backs of people directing their speech and their movements only towards members of their own side.
These clothes were the only thing that puzzled  K, as he would otherwise have taken the whole assembly for a local political meeting.
At the other end of the hall where K had been led there was a little table set at an angle on a very low podium which was as overcrowded as everywhere else, and behind the table, near the edge of the podium, sat a small, fat, wheezing man who was talking with someone behind him.
The youth who was leading K had some difficulty in reporting to the man.
He had already tried twice to tell him something, standing on tip- toe, but without getting the man's attention as he sat there above him.
It was only when one of the people up on the podium drew his attention to the youth that the man turned to him and leant down to hear what it was he quietly said.
Then he pulled out his watch and quickly looked over at K  You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago, he said.
K was going to give him a reply but had no time to do so, as hardly had the man spoken than a general muttering arose all over the right hand side of the hall.
You should have been here one hour and five minutes ago, the man now repeated, raising his voice this time, and quickly looked round the hall beneath him.
Now the hall was much quieter than when K had entered.
Only the people up in the gallery had not stopped passing remarks.
As far as could be distinguished, up in the half-darkness, dust and haze, they seemed to be less well dressed than those below.
Many of them had brought pillows that they had put between their heads and the ceiling so that they would not hurt themselves pressed against it.
K had decided he would do more watching than talking, so he did not defend himself for supposedly having come late, and simply said, Well maybe I have arrived late, I'm here now.
There followed loud applause, once more from the right hand side of the hall.
Easy people to get on your side, thought K, and was bothered only by the quiet from the left hand side which was directly behind him and from which there was applause from only a few individuals.
He wondered what he could say to get all of them to support him together or, if that were not possible, to at least get the support of the others for a while.
Yes, said the man, but I'm now no longer under any obligation to hear your case - there was once more a muttering, but this time it was misleading as the man waved the people's objections aside with his hand and continued - I will, however, as an exception, continue with it today.
But you should never arrive late like this again.
And now, step forward!
He stood pressed closely against the table, the press of the crowd behind him was so great that he had to press back against it if he did not want to push the judge's desk down off the podium and perhaps the judge along with it.
The judge, however, paid no attention to that but sat very comfortably on his chair and, after saying a few words to close his discussion with the man behind him, reached for a little note book, the only item on his desk.
Now then, said the judge, thumbing through the book.
No, said K, I am the chief clerk in a large bank.
This reply was followed by laughter among the right hand faction down in the hall, it was so hearty that K couldn't stop himself joining in with it.
Even some of those in the gallery were laughing.
The judge had become quite cross but seemed to have no power over those below him in the hall, he tried to reduce what harm had been done in the gallery and jumped up threatening them, his eyebrows, until then hardly remarkable, pushed themselves up and became big, black and bushy over his eyes.
The left hand side of the hall was still quiet, though, the people stood there in rows with their faces looking towards the podium listening to what was being said there, they observed the noise from the other side of the hall with the same quietness and even allowed some individuals from their own ranks, here and there, to go forward into the other faction.
The people in the left faction were not only fewer in number than the right but probably were no more important than them, although their behaviour was calmer and that made it seem like they were.
Your question, My Lord, as to whether I am a house painter - in fact even more than that, you did not ask at all but merely imposed it on me - is symptomatic of the whole way these proceedings against me are being carried out.
Perhaps you will object that there are no proceedings against me.
It's impossible not to observe all this business without feeling pity.
I don't say things are being done without due care but I would like to make it clear that it is I who make the acknowledgement.
K stopped speaking and looked down into the hall.
It should have been rewarded with some applause here and there but everything was quiet, they were all clearly waiting for what would follow, perhaps the quietness was laying the ground for an outbreak of activity that would bring this whole affair to an end.
It was somewhat disturbing that just then the door at the end of the hall opened, the young washerwoman, who seemed to have finished her work, came in and, despite all her caution, attracted the attention of some of the people there.
Until then, he had listened to him standing, as K's speech had taken him by surprise while he was directing his attention to the gallery.
K was satisfied to hear nothing but his own quiet words in this room full of strangers, and he even dared casually to pick up the examining judge's notebook and, touching it only with the tips of his fingers as if it were something revolting, lifted it in the air, holding it just by one of the middle pages so that the others on each side of it, closely written, blotted and yellowing, flapped down.
You can read in your book as much as you like, sir, I really don't have anything in this charge book to be afraid of, even though I don't have access to it as I wouldn't want it in my hand, I can only touch it with two fingers.
The judge grabbed the notebook from where it had fallen on the desk - which could only have been a sign of his deep humiliation, or at least that is how it must have been perceived - tried to tidy it up a little, and held it once more in front of himself in order to read from it.
The people in the front row looked up at him, showing such tension on their faces that he looked back down at them for some time.
Every one of them was an old man, some of them with white beards.
They had sunk into a state of  motionlessness while K gave his oration, and it had not been possible to raise them from this passivity even when the judge was being humiliated.
What has happened to me, continued K, with less of the vigour he had had earlier, he continually scanned the faces in the first row, and this gave his address a somewhat nervous and distracted character, what has happened to me is not just an isolated case.
If it were it would not be of much importance as it's not of much importance to me, but it is a symptom of proceedings which are carried out against many.
It's on behalf of them that I stand here now, not for myself alone.
Without having intended it, he had raised his voice.
Why not then?
Bravo!
Again I say, Bravo!
Not even K thought him of any importance but it did raise his spirits; he no longer thought it at all necessary that all of those in the hall should applaud him, it was enough if the majority of them began  to think about the matter and if only one of them, now and then, was persuaded.
All that I want is a public discussion of a public wrong.
Listen: ten days ago I was placed under arrest, the arrest itself is something I laugh about but that's beside the point.
They came for me in the morning when I was still in bed.
Maybe the order had been given to arrest some house painter - that seems possible after what the judge has said - someone who is as innocent as I am, but it was me they chose.
There were two police thugs occupying the next room.
They could not have taken better precautions if I had been a dangerous robber.
And these policemen were unprincipled riff-raff, they talked at me till I was sick of it, they wanted bribes, they wanted to trick me into giving them my clothes, they wanted money, supposedly so that they could bring me my breakfast after they had blatantly eaten my own breakfast in front of my eyes.
And even that was not enough.
I was led in front of the supervisor in another room.
This was the room of a lady who I have a lot of respect for, and I was forced to look on while the supervisor and the policemen made quite a mess of this room because of me, although not through any fault of mine.
It was not easy to stay calm, but I managed to do so and was completely calm when I asked the supervisor why it was that I was under arrest.
If he were here he would have to confirm what I say.
What do you think he answered?
What he told me, gentlemen, was basically nothing at all; perhaps he really did know nothing, he had placed me under arrest and was satisfied.
In fact he had done more than that and brought three junior employees from the bank where I work into the lady's room; they had made themselves busy interfering with some photographs that belonged to the lady and causing a mess.
There was, of course, another reason for bringing these employees; they, just like my landlady and her maid, were expected to spread the news of my arrest and damage my public reputation and in particular to remove me from my position at the bank.
Well they didn't succeed in any of that, not in the slightest, even my landlady, who is quite a simple person - and I will give you here her name in full respect, her name is Mrs Grubach - even Mrs Grubach was understanding enough to see that an arrest like this has no more significance than an attack carried out on the street by some youths who are not kept under proper control.
I repeat, this whole affair has caused me nothing but unpleasantness and temporary irritation, but could it not also have had some far worse consequences?
K broke off here and looked at the judge, who said nothing.
There seems to be someone among you who is taking directions from above.
I don't know whether the sign is meant to produce booing or applause, but I'll resist trying to guess what its meaning is too soon.
The man behind him, whom he had been talking with earlier, leant forward again, either to give him a few general words of encouragement or some specific piece of advice.
Below them in the hall the people talked to each other quietly but animatedly.
The two factions  had earlier seemed to hold views strongly opposed to each other but now they began to intermingle, a few individuals pointed up at K, others pointed at the judge.
The air in the room was fuggy and extremely oppressive, those who were standing furthest away could hardly even be seen through it.
It must have been especially troublesome for those visitors who were in the gallery, as they were forced to quietly ask the participants in the assembly what exactly was happening, albeit with timid glances at the judge.
I have nearly finished what I have to say, said K, and as there was no bell available he struck the desk with his fist in a way that startled the judge and his advisor and made them look up from each other.
None of this concerns me, and I am therefore able to make a calm assessment of it, and, assuming that this so-called court is of any real importance, it will be very much to your advantage to listen to what I have to say.
If you want to discuss what I say, please don't bother to write it down until later on, I don't have any time to waste and I'll soon be leaving.
There were no shouts among them as there had been at the start, no-one even applauded, but if they weren't already persuaded they seemed very close to it.
K was pleased at the tension among all the people there as they listened to him, a rustling rose from the silence which was more invigorating than the most ecstatic applause could have been.
In my case this includes my arrest and the examination taking place here today, an organisation that employs policemen who can be bribed, oafish supervisors and judges of whom nothing better can be said than that they are not as arrogant as some others.
This organisation even maintains a high-level judiciary along with its train of countless servants, scribes, policemen and all the other assistance that  it needs, perhaps even executioners and torturers - I'm not afraid of using those words.
And what, gentlemen, is the purpose of this enormous organisation?
Its purpose is to arrest innocent people and wage pointless prosecutions against them which, as in my case, lead to no result.
That is why policemen try to steal the clothes off the back of those they arrest, that is why supervisors break into the homes of people they do not know, that is why innocent people are humiliated in front of crowds rather than being given a proper trial.
The policemen only talked about the warehouses where they put the property of those they arrest, I would like to see these warehouses where the hard won possessions of people under arrest is left to decay, if, that is, it's not stolen by the thieving hands of the warehouse workers.
K was interrupted by a screeching from the far end of the hall, he shaded his eyes to see that far, as the dull light of day made the smoke whitish and hard to see through.
It was hard to see now whether it was her fault or not.
A small circle had formed around the two of them, the visitors near him in the gallery seemed delighted that the serious tone K had introduced into the gathering had been disturbed in this way.
K's first thought was to run over there, and he also thought that everyone would want to bring things back into order there or at least to make the pair leave the room, but the first row of people in front of him stayed were they were, no-one moved and no-one let K through.
On the contrary, they stood in his way, old men held out their arms in front of him and a hand from somewhere - he did not have the time to turn round - took hold of his collar.
K, by this time, had forgotten about the pair, it seemed to him that his freedom was being limited as if his arrest was being taken seriously, and, without any thought for what he was doing, he jumped down from the podium.
Now he stood face to face with the crowd.
Had he judged the people properly?
Had he put too much faith in the effect of his speech?
Had they been putting up a pretence all the time he had been speaking, and now that he come to the end and to what must follow, were they tired of pretending?
What faces they were, all around him!
Dark, little eyes flickered here and there, cheeks drooped down like on drunken men, their long beards were thin and stiff, if they took hold of them it was more like they were making their hands into claws, not as if they were taking hold of their own beards.
But underneath those beards - and this was the real discovery made by K - there were badges of various sizes and colours shining on the collars of their coats.
As far as he could see, every one of them was wearing one of these badges.
All of them belonged to the same group, even though they seemed to be divided to the right and the left of him, and when he suddenly turned round he saw the same badge on the collar of the examining judge who calmly looked down at him with his hands in his lap.
So, called out K, throwing his arms in the air as if this sudden realisation needed more room, all of you are working for this organisation, I see now that you are all the very bunch of cheats and liars I've just been speaking about, you've all pressed yourselves in here in order to listen in and snoop on me, you gave the impression of having formed into factions, one of you even applauded me to test me out, and you wanted to learn how to trap an innocent man!
Well, I hope you haven't come here for nothing, I hope you've either had some fun from someone who expected you to defend his innocence or else - let go of me or I'll hit you, shouted K to a quivery old man who had pressed himself especially close to him - or else that you've actually learned something.
And so I wish you good luck in your trade.
He briskly took his hat from where it lay on the edge of the table and, surrounded by a silence caused perhaps by the completeness of their surprise, pushed his way to the exit.
One moment, he said.
I merely wanted to draw your attention, said the judge, to something you seem not yet to be aware of: today, you have robbed yourself of the advantages that a hearing of this sort always gives to someone who is under arrest.
K laughed towards the door.
You bunch of louts, he called, you can keep all your hearings as a present from me, then opened the door and hurried down the steps.
Behind him, the noise of the assembly rose as it became lively once more and probably began to discuss these events as if making a scientific study of them.
Every day over the following week, K expected another summons to arrive, he could not believe that his rejection of any more hearings had been taken literally, and when the expected summons really had not come by Saturday evening he took it to mean that he was expected, without being told, to appear at the same place at the same time.
So on Sunday, he set out once more in the same direction, going without hesitation up the steps and through the corridors; some of the people remembered him and greeted him from their doorways, but he no longer needed to ask anyone the way and soon arrived at the right door.
It was opened as soon as he knocked and, paying no attention to the woman he had seen last time who was standing at the doorway, he was about to go straight into the adjoining room when she said to him There's no session today.
She suddenly interrupted herself and lay her hand on K's as if she wanted to calm him down, and whispered, Be quiet, Berthold is watching us.
K slowly looked up.
In the doorway to the courtroom stood a young man, he was short, his legs were not quite straight, and he continually moved his finger round in a short, thin, red beard with which he hoped to make himself look dignified.
K looked at him with some curiosity, he was the first student he had ever met of the unfamiliar discipline of jurisprudence, face to face at least, a man who would even most likely attain high office one day.
The student, in contrast, seemed to take no notice of K at all, he merely withdrew his finger from his beard long enough to beckon to the woman and went over to the window, the woman leant over to K and whispered, Don't be cross with me, please don't, and please don't think ill of me either, I've got to go to him now, to this horrible man, just look at his bent legs.
But I'll come straight back and then I'll go with you if you'll take me, I'll go wherever you want, you can do whatever you like with me, I'll be happy if I can be away from here for as long as possible, it'd be best if I could get away from here for good.
She stroked K's hand once more, jumped up and ran over to the window.
Before he realised it, K grasped for her hand but failed to catch it.
He really was attracted to the woman, and even after thinking hard about it could find no good reason why he should not give in to her allure.
It briefly crossed his mind that the woman meant to entrap him on behalf of the court, but that was an objection he had no difficulty in fending off.
In what way could she entrap him?
Could he not have that much confidence in himself?
And her offer of help sounded sincere, and maybe it wasn't quite worthless.
And maybe there was no better revenge against the examining judge and his cronies than to take this woman from him and have her for himself.
Maybe then, after much hard work writing dishonest reports about K, the judge would go to the woman's bed late one night and find it empty.
And it would be empty because she belonged to K, because this woman at the window, this lush, supple, warm body in its sombre clothes of rough, heavy material belonged to him, totally to him and to him alone.
Once he had settled his thoughts towards the woman in this way, he began to find the quiet conversation at the window was taking too long, he rapped on the podium with his knuckles, and then even with his fist.
The student briefly looked away from the woman to glance at K over his shoulder but did allow himself to be disturbed, in fact he even pressed himself close to the woman and put his arms around her.
She dropped her head down low as if listening to him carefully, as she did so he kissed her right on the neck, hardly even interrupting what he was saying.
K saw this as confirmation of the tyranny the student held over the woman and which she had already complained about, he stood up and walked up and down the room.
Glancing sideways at the student, he wondered what would be the quickest possible way to get rid of him, and so it was not unwelcome to him when the student, clearly disturbed by K's to-ing and fro-ing which K had now developed into a stamping up and down, said to him, You don't have to stay here, you know, if you're getting impatient.
You could have gone earlier, no-one would have missed you.
This comment could have caused all possible rage to break out between them, but K also bore in mind that this was a prospective court official speaking to a disfavoured defendant, and he might well have been taking pride in speaking in this way.
K remained standing quite close to him and said with a smile, You're quite right, I am impatient, but the easiest way to settle this impatience would be if you left us.
On the other hand, if you've come here to study - you are a student, I hear - I'll be quite happy to leave the room to you and go away with the woman.
It's true that I'm still not all that familiar with your branch of jurisprudence but I take it it involves a lot more than speaking roughly - and I see you have no shame in doing that extremely well.
He shouldn't have been allowed to move about so freely, said the student, as if he wanted to give the woman an explanation for K's insults, that was a mistake.
I've told the examining judge so.
He should at least have been detained in his room between hearings.
Sometimes it's impossible to understand what the judge thinks he's doing.
So that's it, said the student, oh no, you're not going to get her, and with a strength you would not have expected from him, he glanced tenderly at her, lifted her up on one arm and, his back bent under the weight, ran with her to the door.
In this way he showed, unmistakeably, that he was to some extent afraid of K, but he nonetheless dared to provoke him still further by stroking and squeezing the woman's arm with his free hand.
K ran the few steps up to him, but when he had reached him and was about to take hold of him and, if necessary, throttle him, the woman said, It's no good, it's the examining judge who's sent for me, I daren't go with you, this little bastard..
K was curious to see where the woman would be taken and he hurried over to the door, the student was not likely to carry her through the streets on his arm.
It turned out that the journey was far shorter.
Directly opposite the flat there was a narrow flight of wooden steps which probably led up to the attic, they turned as they went so that it was not possible to see where they ended.
The student carried the woman up these steps, and after the exertions of running with her he was soon groaning and moving very slowly.
The woman waved down at K and by raising and lowering her shoulders she tried to show that she was an innocent party in this abduction, although the gesture did not show a lot of regret.
K watched her without expression like a stranger, he wanted to show neither that he was disappointed nor that he would easily get over his disappointment.
The two of them had disappeared, but K remained standing in the doorway.
He had to accept that the woman had not only cheated him but that she had also lied to him when she said she was being taken to the examining judge.
The examining judge certainly wouldn't be sitting and waiting in the attic.
The wooden stairs would explain nothing to him however long he stared at them.
Then K noticed a small piece of paper next to them, went across to it and read, in a childish and unpractised hand, Entrance to the Court Offices.
Were the court offices here, in the attic of this tenement, then?
If that was how they were accommodated it did not attract much respect, and it was some comfort for the accused to realise how little money this court had at its disposal if it had to locate its offices in a place where the tenants of the building, who were themselves among the poorest of people, would throw their unneeded junk.
On the other hand, it was possible that the officials  had enough money but that they squandered it on themselves rather than use it for the court's purposes.
Going by K's experience of them so far, that even seemed probable, except that if the court were allowed to decay in that way it would not just humiliate the accused but also give him more encouragement than if the court were simply  in a state of poverty.
K also now understood that the court was ashamed to summon those it accused to the attic of this building for the initial hearing, and why it preferred to impose upon them in their own homes.
K, at the bank, had a big office with an ante-room, and had an enormous window through which he could look down at the activity in the square.
It was true, though, that he had no secondary income from bribes and fraud, and he couldn't tell a servant to bring him a woman up to the office on his arm.
K, however, was quite willing to do without such things, in this life at least.
K was still looking at the notice when a man came up the stairs, looked through the open door into the living room where it was also possible to see the courtroom, and finally asked K whether he had just seen a woman there.
At the entrance he nearly fell over, as behind the door there was another step.
They don't show much concern for the public, he said.
There was no direct source of light but it was not entirely dark as many of the departments, instead of solid walls, had just wooden bars reaching up to the ceiling to separate them from the corridor.
The light made its way in through them, and it was also possible to see individual officials through them as they sat writing at their desks or stood up at the wooden frameworks and watched the people on the corridor through the gaps.
There were only a few people in the corridor, probably because it was Sunday.
They were not very impressive.
All of them were carelessly dressed although the expressions on their faces, their bearing, the style of their beards and many details which were hard to identify showed that they belonged to the upper classes.
There were no coat hooks for them to use, and so they had placed their hats under the bench, each probably having followed the example of the others.
When those who were sitting nearest the door saw K and the usher of the court they stood up to greet them, and when the others saw that, they also thought they had to greet them, so that as the two of them went by all the people there stood up.
K waited for the usher, who was following just behind him.
They must all be very dispirited, he said.
K didn't concern himself long with the guard or these people, especially as he saw a turning off the corridor, about half way along it on the right hand side, where there was no door to stop him going that way.
The usher remained always one or two steps behind K, which he found irritating as in a place like this it could give the impression that he was being driven along by someone who had arrested him, so he frequently waited for the usher to catch up, but the usher always remained behind him.
You haven't seen everything yet, said the usher ingenuously.
But he must have seemed very odd standing there in silence, and the young woman and the usher were indeed looking at him as if they thought he would go through some major metamorphosis any second which they didn't want to miss seeing.
And in the doorway stood the man whom K had noticed in the background earlier, he held firmly on to the beam above the low door swinging a little on the tips of his feet as if becoming impatient as he watched.
But the young woman was the first to recognise that K's behaviour was caused by his feeling slightly unwell, she brought a chair and asked, Would you not like to sit down?
The man, however, didn't follow this suggestion but just stood there with his hands in his trouser pockets and laughed out loud.
There, you see, he said to the girl, I was quite right.
The gentleman is only unwell here, and not in general.
He would come straight home from the office, remain in her room without the light on, and sit on the sofa with nothing more to distract him than keeping watch on the empty hallway.
He got up an hour earlier than usual in the morning so that he might perhaps find Miss Bürstner alone as she went to the office.
But none of these efforts brought any success.
Then he wrote her a letter, both to the office and the flat, attempting once more to justify his behaviour, offered to make whatever amends he could, promised never to cross whatever boundary she might set him and begged merely to have the chance to speak to her some time, especially as he was unable to do anything with Mrs Grubach either until he had spoken with Miss Bürstner, he finally informed her that the following Sunday he would stay in his room all day waiting for a sign from her that there was some hope of his request being fulfilled, or at least that she would explain to him why she could not fulfil it even though he had promised to observe whatever stipulations she might make.
The letters were not returned, but there was no answer either.
However, on the following Sunday there was a sign that seemed clear enough.
It was still early when K noticed, through the keyhole, that there was an unusual level of activity in the hallway which soon abated.
A French teacher, although she was German and called Montag, a pale and febrile girl with a slight limp who had previously occupied a room of her own, was moving into Miss Bürstner's room.
She could be seen shuffling through the hallway for several hours, there was always another piece of clothing or a blanket or a book that she had forgotten and had to be fetched specially and brought into the new home.
When Mrs Grubach brought K his breakfast - ever since the time when she had made K so cross she didn't trust the maid to do the slightest job - he had no choice but to speak to her, for the first time in five days.
Oh, don't cry Mrs Grubach, said K, looking out the window, he was thinking only of Miss Bürstner and how she was accepting an unknown girl into her room.
I meant no harm either when I said that.
It was simply a misunderstanding between us.
That can happen even between old friends sometimes.
Well, yes, that's how it is, said K, and as Mrs Grubach's behaviour indicated that the captain had said nothing he dared to add, Do you really think, then, that I'd want to make an enemy of you for the sake of a girl we hardly know?
Yes, you're quite right, Mr K, said Mrs Grubach, and then, to her misfortune, as soon as she felt just a little freer to speak, she added something rather inept.
K said nothing in reply, he should have chased her from the room as soon as she had opened her mouth, and he didn't want to do that.
Just as K once more reached the door, someone knocked at it.
It was the maid, to say that Miss Montag would like to have a few words with Mr K, and therefore requested that he come to the dining room where she was waiting for him.
K heard the maid out thoughtfully, and then looked back at the shocked Mrs Grubach in a way that was almost contemptuous.
His look seemed to be saying that K had been expecting this invitation for Miss Montag for a long time, and that it was confirmation of the suffering he had been made to endure that Sunday morning from Mrs Grubach's tenants.
He sent the maid back with the reply that he was on his way, then he went to the wardrobe to change his coat, and in answer to Mrs Grubach's gentle whining about the nuisance Miss Montag was causing merely asked her to clear away the breakfast things.
But you've hardly touched it, said Mrs Grubach.
The room was long but narrow with one window.
There was only enough space available to put two cupboards at an angle in the corner by the door, and the rest of the room was entirely taken up with the long dining table which started by the door and reached all the way to the great window, which was thus made almost inaccessible.
The table was already laid for a large number of people, as on Sundays almost all the tenants ate their dinner here at midday.
They greeted each other in silence.
K looked at her with a frown.
One evening, a few days later, K was walking along one of the corridors that separated his office from the main stairway - he was nearly the last one to leave for home that evening, there remained only a couple of workers in the light of a single bulb in the dispatch department - when he heard a sigh from behind a door which he had himself never opened but which he had always thought just led into a junk room.
For a while there was silence, but then came some more sighs.
His first thought was to fetch one of the servitors, it might well have been worth having a witness present, but then he was taken by an uncontrollable curiosity that make him simply yank the door open.
It was, as he had thought, a junk room.
Old, unusable forms, empty stone ink-bottles lay scattered behind the entrance.
A candle fixed on a shelf gave them light.
In the distance, he heard the steps of the servitors; he did not want them to be too aware of his presence, so he closed the window and walked towards the main staircase.
At the door of the junk room he stopped and listened for a little while.
All was silent.
K reached his hand out for the door handle but drew it suddenly back.
He was no longer in any position to help anyone, and the servitors would soon be back;  he did, though, promise himself that he would raise the matter again with somebody and see that, as far as it was in his power, those who really were guilty, the high officials whom nobody had so far dared point out to him, received their due punishment.
As he went down the main stairway at the front of the bank,  he looked carefully round at everyone who was passing, but there was no girl to be seen who might have been waiting for somebody, not even within some distance from the bank.
Franz's claim that his bride was waiting for him was thus shown to be a lie, albeit one that was forgivable and intended only to elicit more sympathy.
The policemen were still on K's mind all through the following day; he was unable to concentrate on his work and had to stay in his office a little longer than the previous day so that he could finish it.
Instead of the darkness he expected, he saw everything unchanged from the previous evening, and did not know how he should respond.
The forms and bottles of ink just inside the doorway, the whip-man with his cane, the two policemen, still undressed, the candle on the shelf, and the two policemen began to wail and call out Mr K!
One afternoon - K was very busy at the time, getting the post ready - K's Uncle Karl, a small country land owner, came into the room, pushing his way between two of the staff who were bringing in some papers.
K had long expected his uncle to appear, but the sight of him now shocked K far less than the prospect of it had done a long time before.
His uncle was bound to come, K had been sure of that for about a month.
He already thought at the time he could see how his uncle would arrive, slightly bowed, his battered panama hat in his left hand, his right hand already stretched out over the desk long before he was close enough as he rushed carelessly towards K knocking over everything that was in his way.
K's uncle was always in a hurry, as he suffered from the unfortunate belief that he had a number of things to do while he was in the big city and had to settle all of them in one day - his visits were only ever for one day - and at the same time thought he could not forgo any conversation or piece of business or pleasure that might arise by chance.
Uncle Karl was K's former guardian, and so K was duty-bound to help him in all of this as well as to offer him a bed for the night.
'I'm haunted by a ghost from the country', he would say.
As soon as they had greeted each other - K had invited him to sit in the armchair but Uncle Karl had no time for that - he said he wanted to speak briefly with K in private.
He had hardly stepped into the hallway, finding his bearings in the darkness with his hand still firmly holding the door, when another small hand, much smaller than K's own, placed itself on his and gently shut the door.
It was the carer who had been waiting there.
I was thinking about you, as well, replied K uneasily.
So much the better, said the carer.
Come with me.
Come in here, she said.
It was clearly the lawyer's office, fitted out with old, heavy furniture, as far as could be seen in the moonlight which now illuminated just a small, rectangular section of the floor by each of the three big windows.
When he had sat down, K continued to look round the room, it was a large room with a high ceiling, the clients of this lawyer for the poor must have felt quite lost in it.
But then he forgot about all of this and had eyes only for the carer who sat very close beside him, almost pressing him against the armrest.
It was odd.
First you stare at me as soon as you come in, and then you keep me waiting.
Gladly, said K  But as for its being odd, Leni, that's easy to explain.
Firstly, I had to listen to what the old men were saying and couldn't leave without a good reason, but secondly I'm not a bold  person, if anything I'm quite shy, and you, Leni, you didn't really look like you could be won over in one stroke, either.
That's not it, said Leni, laying one arm on the armrest and looking at K, you didn't like me, and I don't suppose you like me now, either.
Liking wouldn't be very much, said K, evasively.
One winter morning - snow was falling in the dull light outside - K was sitting in his office, already extremely tired despite the early hour.
He had told the servitor he was engaged in a major piece of work and none of the junior staff should be allowed in to see him, so he would not be disturbed by them at least.
But instead of working he turned round in his chair, slowly moved various items around his desk, but then, without being aware of it, he lay his arm stretched out on the desk top and sat there immobile with his head sunk down on his chest.
He was no longer able to get the thought of the trial out of his head.
It would contain a short description of his life and explain why he had acted the way he had at each event that was in any way important, whether he now considered he had acted well or ill, and his reasons for each.
There was no doubt of the advantages a written defence of this sort would have over relying on the lawyer, who was anyway not without his shortcomings.
K had no idea what actions the lawyer was taking; it was certainly not a lot, it was more than a month since the lawyer had summoned him, and none of the previous discussions had given K the impression that this man would be able to do much for him.
Most importantly, he had asked him hardly any questions.
And there were so many questions here to be asked.
Asking questions were the most important thing.
The lawyer, in contrast, did not ask questions but did all the talking himself or sat silently facing him, leant forward slightly over the desk, probably because he was hard of hearing, pulled on a strand of hair in the middle of his beard and looked down at the carpet, perhaps at the very spot where K had lain with Leni.
His speeches were as pointless as they were boring, and K decided that when the final bill came he would pay not a penny for them.
Once the lawyer thought he had humiliated K sufficiently, he usually started something that would raise his spirits again.
He had already, he would then say, won many such cases, partly or in whole, cases which may not really have been as difficult as this one but which, on the face of it, had even less hope of success.
He had a list of these cases here in the drawer - here he would tap on one or other of the drawers in his desk - but could, unfortunately, not show them to K as they dealt with official secrets.
Nonetheless, the great experience he had acquired through all these cases would, of course, be of benefit to K  He had, of course, begun work straight away and was nearly ready to submit the first documents.
They would be very important because the first impression made by the defence will often determine the whole course of the proceedings.
Unfortunately, though, he would still have to make it clear to K that the first documents submitted are sometimes not even read by the court.
They simply put them with the other documents and point out that, for the time being, questioning and observing the accused are much more important than anything written.
If the applicant becomes insistent, then they add that before they come to any decision, as soon as all the material has been brought together, with due regard, of course, to all the documents, then these first documents to have been submitted will also be checked over.
But unfortunately, even this is not usually true, the first documents submitted are usually mislaid or lost completely, and even if they do keep them right to the end they are hardly read, although the lawyer only knew about this from rumour.
This is all very regrettable, but not entirely without its justifications.
But K should not forget that the trial would not be public, if the court deems it necessary it can be made public but there is no law that says it has to be.
As a result, the accused and his defence don't have access even to the court records, and especially not to the indictment, and that means we generally don't know - or at least not precisely - what the first documents need to be about, which means that if they do contain anything of relevance to the case it's only by a lucky coincidence.
If anything about the individual charges and the reasons for them comes out clearly or can be guessed at while the accused is being questioned, then it's possible to work out and submit documents that really direct the issue and present proof, but not before.
But that is what they intend.
In fact, defence is not really allowed under the law, it's only tolerated, and there is even some dispute about whether the relevant parts of the law imply even that.
So strictly speaking, there is no such thing as a counsel acknowledged by the court, and anyone who comes before this court as counsel is basically no more than a barrack room lawyer.
The effect of all this, of course, is to remove the dignity of the whole procedure, the next time K is in the court offices he might like to have a look in at the lawyers' room, just so that he's seen it.
He might well be quite shocked by the people he sees assembled there.
The room they've been allocated, with its narrow space and low ceiling, will be enough to show what contempt the court has for these people.
The only light in the room comes through a little window that is so high up that, if you want to look out of it, you first have to get one of your colleagues to support you on his back, and even then the smoke from the chimney just in front of it will go up your nose and make your face black.
In the floor of this room - to give yet another example of the conditions there - there is a hole that's been there for more than a year, it's not so big that a man could fall through, but it is big enough for your foot to disappear through it.
The lawyers' room is on the second floor of the attic; if your foot does go through it will hang down into the first floor of the attic underneath it, and right in the corridor where the litigants are waiting.
It's no exaggeration when lawyers say that conditions like that are a disgrace.
Complaints to the management don't have the slightest effect, but the lawyers are strictly forbidden to alter anything in the room at their own expense.
But even treating the lawyers in this way has its reasons.
They want, as far as possible, to prevent any kind of defence, everything should be made the responsibility of the accused.
Not a bad point of view, basically, but nothing could be more mistaken than to think from that that lawyers are not necessary for the accused in this court.
On the contrary, there is no court where they are less needed than here.
And the accused doesn't get to see the court records either, and it's very difficult to infer what's in the court records from what's been said during questioning based on them, especially for the accused who is in a difficult situation and is faced with every possible worry to distract him.
This is when the defence begins.
Counsel for the defence are not normally allowed to be present while the accused is being questioned, so afterwards, and if possible still at the door of the interview room, he has to learn what he can about it from him and extract whatever he can that might be of use, even though what the accused has to report is often very confused.
But that is not the most important thing, as there's really not a lot that can be learned in this way, although in this, as with anything else, a competent man will learn more than another.
Nonetheless, the most important thing is the lawyer's personal connections, that's where the real value of taking counsel lies.
Now K will most likely have already learned from his own experience that, among its very lowest orders, the court organisation does have its imperfections, the court is strictly closed to the public, but staff who forget their duty or who take bribes do, to some extent, show where the gaps are.
This is where most lawyers will push their way in, this is where bribes are paid and information extracted, there have even, in earlier times at least, been incidents where documents have been stolen.
There's no denying that some surprisingly favourable results have been attained for the accused in this way, for a limited time, and these petty advocates then strut to and fro on the basis of them and attract new clients, but for the further course of the proceedings it signifies either nothing or nothing good.
The only things of real value are honest personal contacts, contacts with higher officials, albeit higher officials of the lower grades, you understand.
That is the only way the progress of the trial can be influenced, hardly noticeable at first, it's true, but from then on it becomes more and more visible.
There were probably no more than one or two who had as many contacts as Dr.
This means they have all the less contact with the court officials.
It is not at all necessary for Dr.
Huld to go to the court, wait in the ante-rooms for the examining judges to turn up, if they turn up, and try to achieve something which, according to the judges' mood is usually more apparent than real and most often not even that.
No, K has seen for himself that the court officials, including some who are quite high up, come forward without being asked, are glad to give information which is fully open or at least easy to understand, they discuss the next stages in the proceedings, in fact in some cases they can be won over and are quite willing to adopt the other person's point of view.
However, when this happens, you should never trust them too far, as however firmly they may have declared this new point of view in favour of the defendant they might well go straight back to their offices and write a report for the court that says just the opposite, and might well be even harder on the defendant than the original view, the one they insist they've been fully dissuaded from.
And, of course, there's no way of defending yourself from this, something said in private is indeed in private and cannot then be used in public, it's not something that makes it easy for the defence to keep those gentlemen's favour.
On the other hand, it's also true that the gentlemen don't become involved with the defence - which will of course be done with great expertise - just for philanthropic reasons or in order to be friendly, in some respects it would be truer to say that they, too, have it allocated to them.
This is where the disadvantages of a court structure that, right from the start, stipulates that all proceedings take place in private, come into force.
In normal, mediocre trials its officials have contact with the public, and they're very well equipped for it, but here they don't; normal trials run their course all by themselves, almost, and just need a nudge here and there; but when they're faced with cases that are especially difficult they're as lost as they often are with ones that are very simple; they're forced to spend all their time, day and night, with their laws, and so they don't have the right feel for human relationships, and that's a serious shortcoming in cases like this.
That's when they come for advice to the lawyer, with a servant behind them carrying the documents which normally are kept so secret.
You could have seen many gentlemen at this window, gentlemen of whom you would least expect it, staring out this window in despair on the street below while the lawyer is at his desk studying the documents so that he can give them good advice.
And at times like that it's also possible to see how exceptionally seriously these gentlemen take their professions and how they are thrown into great confusion by difficulties which it's just not in their natures to overcome.
The different ranks and hierarchies of the court are endless, and even someone who knows his way around them cannot always tell what's going to happen.
But even for the junior officials, the proceedings in the courtrooms are usually kept secret, so they are hardly able to see how the cases they work with proceed, court affairs appear in their range of vision often without their knowing where they come from and they move on further without their learning where they go.
So civil servants like this are not able to learn the things you can learn from studying the successive stages that individual trials go through, the final verdict or the reasons for it.
They're only allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law allocates them, and they usually know less about the results of their work after it's left them than the defence does, even though the defence will usually stay in contact with the accused until the trial is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can learn many useful things from the defence.
Bearing all this in mind, does it still surprise K that the officials are irritated and often express themselves about the litigants in unflattering ways - which is an experience shared by everyone.
All the officials are irritated, even when they appear calm.
This causes many difficulties for the junior advocates, of course.
There is a story, for instance, that has very much the ring of truth about it.
It goes like this: One of the older officials, a good and peaceful man, was dealing with a difficult matter for the court which had become very confused, especially thanks to the contributions from the lawyers.
He had been studying it for a day and a night without a break - as these officials are indeed hard working, no-one works as hard as they do.
When it was nearly morning, and he had been working for twenty-four hours with probably very little result, he went to the front entrance, waited there in ambush, and every time a lawyer tried to enter the building he would throw him down the steps.
The lawyers gathered together down in front of the steps and discussed with each other what they should do; on the one hand they had actually no right to be allowed into the building so that there was hardly anything that they could legally do to the official and, as I've already mentioned, they would have to be careful not to set all the officials against them.
On the other hand, any day not spent in court is a day lost for them and it was a matter of some importance to force their way inside.
In the end, they agreed that they would try to tire the old man out.
One lawyer after another was sent out to run up the steps and let himself be thrown down again, offering what resistance he could as long as it was passive resistance, and his colleagues would catch him at the bottom of the steps.
That went on for about an hour until the old gentleman, who was already exhausted from working all night, was very tired and went back to his office.
Those who were at the bottom of the steps could not believe it at first, so they sent somebody out to go and look behind the door to see if there really was no-one there, and only then did they all gather together and probably didn't even dare to complain, as it's far from being the lawyers' job to introduce any improvements in the court system, or even to want to.
Even the most junior lawyer can understand the relationship there to some extent, but one significant point is that almost every defendant, even very simple people, begins to think of suggestions for improving the court as soon as his proceedings have begun, many of them often even spend time and energy on the matter that could be spent far better elsewhere.
The only right thing to do is to learn how to deal with the situation as it is.
Even if it were possible to improve any detail of it - which is anyway no more than superstitious nonsense - the best that they could achieve, although doing themselves incalculable harm in the process, is that they will have attracted the special attention of the officials for any case that comes up in the future, and the officials are always ready to seek revenge.
Never attract attention to yourself!
Stay calm, however much it goes against your character!
Try to gain some insight into the size of the court organism and how, to some extent, it remains in a state of suspension, and that even if you alter something in one place you'll draw the ground out from under your feet and might fall, whereas if an enormous organism like the court is disrupted in any one place it finds it easy to provide a substitute for itself somewhere else.
Everything is connected with everything else and will continue without any change or else, which is quite probable, even more closed, more attentive, more strict, more malevolent.
So it's best to leave the work to the lawyers and not to keep disturbing them.
It doesn't do much good to make accusations, especially if you can't make it clear what they're based on and their full significance, but it must be said that K caused a great deal of harm to his own case by his behaviour towards the office director, he was a very influential man but now he might as well be struck off the list of those who might do anything for K  If the trial is mentioned, even just in passing,  it's quite obvious that he's ignoring it.
These officials are in many ways just like children.
Often, something quite harmless - although K's behaviour could unfortunately not be called harmless - will leave them feeling so offended that they will even stop talking with good friends of theirs, they turn away when they see them and do everything they can to oppose them.
But then, with no particular reason, surprisingly enough, some little joke that was only ever attempted because everything seemed so hopeless will make them laugh and they'll be reconciled.
It's sometimes quite astonishing that a single, average life is enough to encompass so much that it's at all possible ever to have any success in one's work here.
On the other hand, there are also dark moments, such as everyone has, when you think you've achieved nothing at all, when it seems that the only trials to come to a good end are those that were determined to have a good end from the start and would do so without any help, while all the others are lost despite all the running to and fro, all the effort, all the little, apparent successes that gave such joy.
Then you no longer feel very sure of anything and, if asked about a trial that was doing well by its own nature but which was turned for the worse because you assisted in it, would not even dare deny that.
Lawyers are especially vulnerable to fits of depression of that sort - and they are no more than fits of depression of course - when a case is suddenly taken out of their hands after they've been conducting it satisfactorily for some time.
That's probably the worst that can happen to a lawyer.
It's not that the accused takes the case away from him, that hardly ever happens, once a defendant has taken on a certain lawyer he has to stay with him whatever happens.
How could he ever carry on by himself after he's taken on help from a lawyer?
No, that just doesn't happen, but what does sometimes happen is that the trial takes on a course where the lawyer may not go along with it.
Client and trial are both simply taken away from the lawyer; and then even contact with the court officials won't help, however good they are, as they don't know anything themselves.
The trial will have entered a stage where no more help can be given, where it's being processed in courts to which no-one has any access, where the defendant cannot even be contacted by his lawyer.
You come home one day and find all the documents you've submitted, which you've worked hard to create and which you had the best hopes for, lying on the desk, they've been sent back as they can't be carried through to the next stage in the trial, they're just worthless scraps of paper.
It doesn't mean that the case has been lost, not at all, or at least there is no decisive reason for supposing so, it's just that you don't know anything more about the case and won't be told anything of what's happening.
Well, cases like that are the exceptions, I'm glad to say, and even if K's trial is one of them, it's still, for the time being, a long way off.
As he had said, the time for submitting documents was still in the future and there was no rush to prepare them, it was much more important to start the initial discussions with the appropriate officials, and they had already taken place.
With varying degrees of success, it must be said.
It was much better not to give away any details before their time, as in that way K could only be influenced unfavourably and his hopes might be raised or he might be made too anxious, better just to say that some individuals have spoken very favourably and shown themselves very willing to help, although others have spoken less favourably, but even they have not in any way refused to help.
So all in all, the results are very encouraging, only you should certainly not draw any particular conclusions as all preliminary proceedings begin in the same way and it was only the way they developed further that would show what the value of these preliminary proceedings has been.
Anyway, nothing has been lost yet, and if we can succeed in getting the office director, despite everything, on our side - and several actions have been undertaken to this end - then everything is a clean wound, as a surgeon would say, and we can wait for the results with some comfort.
When he started talking on in this way the lawyer was quite tireless.
He went through it all again every time K went to see him.
The first set of documents to be submitted were being worked on but still not ready, which usually turned out to be a great advantage the next time K went to see him as the earlier occasion would have been a very bad time to put them in, which they could not then have known.
If K, stupefied from all this talking, ever pointed out that even considering all these difficulties progress was very slow, the lawyer would object that progress was not slow at all, but that they might have progressed far further if K had come to him at the right time.
But he had come to him late and that lateness would bring still further difficulties, and not only where time was concerned.
The only welcome interruption during these visits was always when Leni contrived to bring the lawyer his tea while K was there.
Then she would stand behind K - pretending to watch the lawyer as he bent greedily over his cup, poured the tea in and drank - and secretly let K hold her hand.
There was always complete silence.
The lawyer drank.
K squeezed Leni's hand and Leni would sometimes dare to gently stroke K's hair.
Was the lawyer trying to comfort K or to confuse him?
Maybe everything the lawyer said was quite right, even though he obviously wanted to make himself as conspicuous as possible and probably had never even taken on a case as important as he said K's was.
Were they to be exploited solely for K's benefit?
The lawyer never forgot to mention that they were dealing only with junior officials, which meant officials who were dependent on others, and the direction taken in each trial could be important for their own furtherment.
Could it be that they were making use of the lawyer to turn trials in a certain direction, which would, of course, always be at the cost of the defendant?
It certainly did not mean that they would do that in every trial, that was not likely at all, and there were probably also trials where they gave the lawyer advantages and all the room he needed to turn it in the direction he wanted, as it would also be to their advantage to keep his reputation intact.
If that really was their relationship, how would they direct K's trial which, as the lawyer had explained, was especially difficult and therefore important enough to attract great attention from the very first time it came to court?
There could not be much doubt about what they would do.
The first signs of it could already be seen in the fact that the first documents still had not been submitted even though the trial had already lasted several months, and that, according to the lawyer, everything was still in its initial stages, which was very effective, of course, in making the defendant passive and keeping him helpless.
Then he could be suddenly surprised with the verdict, or at least with a notification that the hearing had not decided in his favour and the matter would be passed on to a higher office.
It was essential that K take a hand in it himself.
On winter's mornings such as this, when he was very tired and everything dragged itself lethargically through his head, this belief of his seemed irrefutable.
He no longer felt the contempt for the trial that he had had earlier.
If he had been alone in the world it would have been easy for him to ignore it, although it was also certain that, in that case, the trial would never have arisen in the first place.
But now, his uncle had already dragged him to see the lawyer, he had to take account of his family; his job was no longer totally separate from the progress of the trial, he himself had carelessly - with a certain, inexplicable complacency - mentioned it to acquaintances and others had learned about it in ways he did not know, his relationship with Miss Bürstner seemed to be in trouble because of it.
In short, he no longer had any choice whether he would accept the trial or turn it down, he was in the middle of it and had to defend himself.
If he was tired, then that was bad.
But there was no reason to worry too much before he needed to.
He had been capable of working himself up to his high position in the bank in a relatively short time and to retain it with respect from everyone, now he simply had to apply some of the talents that had made that possible for him to the trial, and there was no doubt that it had to turn out well.
The most important thing, if something was to be achieved, was to reject in advance any idea that he might be in any way guilty.
There was no guilt.
The trial was nothing but a big piece of business, just like he had already concluded to the benefit of the bank many times, a piece of business that concealed many lurking dangers waiting in ambush for him, as they usually did, and these dangers would need to be defended against.
If that was to be achieved then he must not entertain any idea of guilt, whatever he did, he would need to look after his own interests as closely as he could.
Seen in this way, there was no choice but to take his representation away from the lawyer very soon, at best that very evening.
The lawyer had told him, as he talked to him, that that was something unheard of and would probably do him a great deal of harm, but K could not tolerate any impediment to his efforts where his trial was concerned, and these impediments were probably caused by the lawyer himself.
But once he had shaken off the lawyer the documents would need to be submitted straight away and, if possible, he would need to see to it that they were being dealt with every day.
It would of course not be enough, if that was to be done, for K to sit in the corridor with his hat under the bench like the others.
Day after day, he himself, or one of the women or somebody else on his behalf, would have to run after the officials and force them to sit at their desks and study K's documents instead of looking out on the corridor through the grating.
There could be no let-up in these efforts, everything would need to be organised and supervised, it was about time that the court came up against a defendant who knew how to defend and make use of his rights.
Earlier, just a week or so before, he could only have felt shame at the thought of being made to write out such documents himself;  it had never entered his head that the task could also be difficult.
He remembered one morning when, already piled up with work, he suddenly shoved everything to one side and took a pad of paper on which he sketched out some of his thoughts on how documents of this sort should proceed.
Perhaps he would offer them to that slow-witted lawyer, but just then the door of the manager's office opened and the deputy-director entered the room with a loud laugh.
K was very embarrassed, although the deputy-director, of course, was not laughing at K's documents, which he knew nothing about, but at a joke he had just heard about the stock-exchange, a joke which needed an illustration if it was to be understood, and now the deputy- director leant over K's desk, took his pencil from his hand, and drew the illustration on the writing pad that K had intended for his ideas about his case.
If the nights weren't enough he would have to take a holiday.
Needless to say, the documents would mean an almost endless amount of work.
It was easy to come to the belief, not only for those of an anxious disposition, that it was impossible ever to finish it.
This was not because of laziness or deceit, which were the only things that might have hindered the lawyer in preparing it, but because he did not know what the charge was or even what consequences it might bring, so that he had to remember every tiny action and event from the whole of his life, looking at them from all sides and checking and reconsidering them.
It was also a very disheartening job.
But now, just when K needed to apply all his thoughts to his work, when he was still rising and already posed a threat to the deputy-director, when every hour passed so quickly and he wanted to enjoy the brief evenings and nights as a young man, this was the time he had to start working out these documents.
Once more, he began to feel resentment.
As he pressed it he glanced up to the clock.
It was eleven o'clock, two hours, he had spent a great deal of his costly time just dreaming and his wits were, of course, even more dulled than they had been before.
As well as various pieces of mail, the servitors brought two visiting cards from gentlemen who had already been waiting for K for some time.
They were actually very important clients of the bank who should not really have been kept waiting under any circumstances.
Why had they come at such an awkward time, and why, the gentlemen on the other side of the closed door seemed to be asking, was the industrious K using up the best business time for his private affairs?
Tired from what had gone before, and tired in anticipation of what was to follow, K stood up to receive the first of them.
He was a short, jolly man, a manufacturer who K knew well.
He apologised for disturbing K at some important work, and K, for his part, apologised for having kept the manufacturer waiting for so long.
But even this apology was spoken in such a mechanical way and with such false intonation that the manufacturer would certainly have noticed if he had not been fully preoccupied with his business affairs.
Instead, he hurriedly pulled calculations and tables out from all his pockets, spread them out in front of K, explained several items, corrected a little mistake in the arithmetic that he noticed as he quickly glanced over it all, and reminded K of a similar piece of business he'd concluded with him about a year before, mentioning in passing that this time there was another bank  spending great effort to get his business, and finally stopped speaking in order to learn K's opinion on the matter.
And K had indeed, at first, been closely following what the manufacturer was saying, he too was aware of how important the deal was, but unfortunately it did not last, he soon stopped listening, nodded at each of the manufacturer's louder exclamations for a short while, but eventually he stopped doing even that and did no more than stare at the bald head bent over the papers, asking himself when the manufacturer would finally realise that everything he was saying was useless.
When he did stop talking, K really thought at first that this was so that he would have the chance to confess that he was incapable of listening.
Instead, seeing the anticipation on the manufacturer's face, obviously ready to counter any objections made, he was sorry to realise that the business discussion had to be continued.
So he bent his head as if he'd been given an order and began slowly to move his pencil over the papers, now and then he would stop and stare at one of the figures.
The manufacturer thought there must be some objection, perhaps his figures weren't really sound, perhaps they weren't the decisive issue, whatever he thought, the manufacturer covered the papers with his hand and began once again, moving very close to K, to explain what the deal was all about.
It is difficult, said K, pursing his lips.
The only thing that could offer him any guidance were the papers, and the manufacturer had covered them from his view, so he just sank back against the arm of the chair.
Even when the door of the manager's office opened and revealed not very clearly, as if through a veil, the deputy director, he did no more than look up weakly.
K thought no more about the matter, he merely watched the immediate effect of the deputy director's appearance and, for him, the effect was very pleasing;  the manufacturer immediately jumped up from his seat and hurried over to meet the deputy director, although K would have liked to make him ten times livelier as he feared the deputy director might disappear again.
The manufacturer said he was sorry to find the chief clerk so little inclined to do business, pointing to K who, under the view of the deputy director, had bent back down over the papers.
As the two men leant over the desk and the manufacturer made some effort to gain and keep the deputy director's attention, K felt as if they were much bigger than they really were and that their negotiations were about him.
Carefully and slowly turning his eyes upwards, he tried to learn what was taking place above him, took one of the papers from his desk without looking to see what it was, lay it on the flat of his hand and raised it slowly up as he rose up to the level of the two men himself.
He had no particular plan in mind as he did this, but merely felt this was how he would act if only he had finished preparing that great document that was to remove his burden entirely.
The deputy director had been paying all his attention to the conversation and did no more than glance at the paper, he did not read what was written on it at all as what was important for the chief clerk was not important for him, he took it from K's hand saying, Thank you, I'm already familiar with everything, and lay it calmly back on the desk.
K gave him a bitter, sideways look.
But the deputy director did not notice this at all, or if he did notice it it only raised his spirits, he frequently laughed out loud, one time he clearly embarrassed the manufacturer when he raised an objection in a witty way but drew him immediately back out of his embarrassment by commenting adversely on himself, and finally invited him into his office where they could bring the matter to its conclusion.
It's a very important matter, said the manufacturer.
I understand that completely.
And I'm sure the chief clerk ...
- even as he said this he was actually speaking only to the manufacturer - will be very glad to have us take it off his hands.
This is something that needs calm consideration.
But he seems to be over-burdened today, there are even some people in the room outside who've been waiting there for hours for him.
K still had enough control of himself to turn away from the deputy director and direct his friendly, albeit stiff, smile only at the manufacturer, he made no other retaliation, bent down slightly and supported himself with both hands on his desk like a clerk, and watched as the two gentlemen, still talking, took the papers from his desk and disappeared into the manager's office.
In the doorway, the manufacturer turned and said he wouldn't make his farewell with K just yet, he would of course let the chief clerk know about the success of his discussions but he also had a little something to tell him about.
At last, K was by himself.
It did not enter his head to show anyone else into his office and only became vaguely aware of how nice it was that the people outside thought he was still negotiating with the manufacturer and, for this reason, he could not let anyone in to see him, not even the servitor.
He went over to the window, sat down on the ledge beside it, held firmly on to the handle and looked down onto the square outside.
The snow was still falling, the weather still had not brightened up at all.
He remained a long time sitting in this way, not knowing what it actually was that made him so anxious, only occasionally did he glance, slightly startled, over his shoulder at the door to the outer room where, mistakenly, he thought he'd heard some noise.
No-one came, and that made him feel calmer, he went over to the wash stand, rinsed his face with cold water and, his head somewhat clearer, went back to his place by the window.
All the while he had left his defence up to the lawyer his trial had had little basic affect on him, he had observed it from afar as something that was scarcely able to reach him directly, when it suited him he looked to see how things stood but he was also able to draw his head back again whenever he wanted.
Now, in contrast, if he was to conduct his defence himself, he would have to devote himself entirely to the court - for the time being, at least - success would mean, later on, his complete and conclusive liberation, but if he was to achieve this he would have to place himself, to start with, in far greater danger than he had been in so far.
If he ever felt tempted to doubt this, then his experience with the deputy director and the manufacturer that day would be quite enough to convince him of it.
How would it be later?
What would his life be like in the days ahead?
Would he find the way through it all to a happy conclusion?
Did a carefully worked out defence - and any other sort would have made no sense - did a carefully worked out defence not also mean he would need to shut himself off from everything else as much as he could?
Would he survive that?
And how was he to succeed in conducting all this at the bank?
It involved much more than just submitting some documents that he could probably prepare in a few days' leave, although it would have been great temerity to ask for time off from the bank just at that time, it was a whole trial and there was no way of seeing how long it might last.
This was an enormous difficulty that had suddenly been thrown into K's life!
And was he supposed to be doing the bank's work at a time like this?
He looked down at his desk.
While his trial trundled on, while the court officials upstairs in the attic room sat looking at the papers for this trial, should he be worrying about the business of the bank?
Did this not seem like a kind of torture, acknowledged by the court, connected with the trial and which followed him around?
No- one and never.
But he hoped rumours had not reached as far as the deputy director, otherwise he would obviously soon find a way of making use of it to harm K, he would show neither comradeship nor humaneness.
And what about the director?
It was true that he was well disposed towards K, and as soon as he heard about the trial he would probably try to do everything he could to make it easier for him, but he would certainly not devote himself to it.
K at one time had provided the counter-balance to what the deputy director said but the director was now coming more and more under his influence, and the deputy director would also exploit the weakened condition of the director to strengthen his own power.
So what could K hope for?
Maybe considerations of this sort weakened his power of resistance, but it was still necessary not to deceive oneself and to see everything as clearly as it could be seen at that moment.
It was difficult to open and he had to turn the handle with both his hands.
Then, through the whole height and breadth of the window, the mixture of fog and smoke was drawn into the room, filling it with a slight smell of burning.
A few flakes of snow were blown in with it.
It's a horrible autumn, said the manufacturer, who had come into the room unnoticed after seeing the deputy director and now stood behind K  K nodded and looked uneasily at the manufacturer's briefcase, from which he would now probably take the papers and inform K of the result of his negotiations with the deputy director.
However, the manufacturer saw where K was looking, knocked on his briefcase and without opening it said, You'll be wanting to hear how things turned out.
I've already got the contract in my pocket, almost.
He's a charming man, your deputy director - he's got his dangers, though.
He laughed as he shook K's hand and wanted to make him laugh with him.
But to K, it once more seemed suspicious that the manufacturer did not want to show him the papers and saw nothing about his comments to laugh at.
You're looking so worried today.
Quite right, said the manufacturer, who was always in a hurry and could never listen to anyone for very long, everyone has his cross to bear.
K had unconsciously made a step towards the door as if wanting to show the manufacturer out, but the manufacturer said, Chief clerk, there's something else I'd like to mention to you.
I'm very sorry if it's something that'll be a burden to you today of all days but I've been to see you twice already, lately, and each time I forgot all about it.
If I delay it any longer it might well lose its point altogether.
That would be a pity, as I think what I've got to say does have some value.
Before K had had the time to answer, the manufacturer came up close to him, tapped his knuckle lightly on his chest and said quietly, You've got a trial going on, haven't you?
No, no, said the manufacturer, how would the deputy director know about it?
Disappointed, K took the letter and put it in his pocket.
Even at best, the advantage he might derive from this recommendation was incomparably smaller than the damage that lay in the fact of the manufacturer knowing about his trial, and that the painter was spreading the news about.
I'll go there, he said as he took his leave of the manufacturer at the door, or, as I'm very busy at present, I'll write to him, perhaps he would like to come to me in my office some time.
I was sure you'd find the best solution, said the manufacturer.
Although I had thought you'd prefer to avoid inviting people like this Titorelli to the bank and talking about the trial here.
K nodded and accompanied the manufacturer on through the ante-room.
But despite seeming calm on the outside he was actually very shocked; he had told the manufacturer he would write to Titorelli only to show him in some way that he valued his recommendations and would consider the opportunity to speak with Titorelli without delay, but if he had thought Titorelli could offer any worthwhile assistance he would not have delayed.
Was he really able to rely on his own understanding so little?
If it was possible that he might invite a questionable character into the bank with a clear letter, and ask advice from him about his trial, separated from the deputy director by no more than a door, was it not possible or even very likely that there were also other dangers he had failed to see or that he was even running towards?
There was not always someone beside him to warn him.
And just now, just when he would have to act with all the strength he could muster, now a number of doubts of a sort he had never before known had presented themselves and affected his own vigilance!
Now, at least, he found himself quite unable to understand how he could have intended to write to Titorelli and invite him into the bank.
He shook his head at the thought of it once more as the servitor came up beside him and drew his attention to the three gentlemen who were waiting on a bench in the ante-room.
They had already been waiting to see K for a long time.
Now that the servitor was speaking with K they had stood up and each of them wanted to make use of the opportunity to see K before the others.
It had been negligent of the bank to let them waste their time here in the waiting room, but none of them wanted to draw attention to this.
Mr K, ..
But was K not giving up more than he absolutely had to?
By running off to some unknown painter, with, as he had to admit, very little hope of any vague benefit, his renown was suffering damage that could not be repaired.
It would probably be much better to take off his winter coat again and, at the very least, try to win back the two gentlemen who were certainly still waiting in the next room.
If K had not then glimpsed the deputy director in his office, looking for something from his bookshelves as if they were his own, he would probably even have made the attempt.
He turned his face toward him - its many deep folds seemed to show strength rather than age - and immediately began once more to search.
Could you help me look for it, do you think?
K made a step forward, but the deputy director said, thank you, I've already found it, and with a big package of papers, which certainly must have included many more documents than just the copy of the contract, he turned and went back into his own office.
I can't deal with him right now, K said to himself, but once my personal difficulties have been settled, then he'll certainly be the first to get the effect of it, and he certainly won't like it.
Slightly calmed by these thoughts, K gave the servitor, who had already long been holding the door to the corridor open for him, the task of telling the director, when he was able, that K was going out of the bank on a business matter.
As he left the bank he felt almost happy at the thought of being able to devote more of himself to his own business for a while.
He went straight to the painter, who lived in an outlying part of town which was very near to the court offices, although this area was even poorer, the houses were darker, the streets were full of dirt that slowly blew about over the half-melted snow.
In the great gateway to the building where the painter lived only one of the two doors was open, a hole had been broken open in the wall by the other door, and as K approached it a repulsive, yellow, steaming liquid shot out causing some rats to scurry away into the nearby canal.
Down by the staircase there was a small child lying on its belly crying, but it could hardly be heard because of the noise from a metal-workshop on the other side of the entrance hall, drowning out any other sound.
The door to the workshop was open, three workers stood in a circle around some piece of work that they were beating with hammers.
A large tin plate hung on the wall, casting a pale light that pushed its way in between two of the workers, lighting up their faces and their work-aprons.
K did no more than glance at any of these things, he wanted to get things over with here as soon as possible, to exchange just a few words to find out how things stood with the painter and go straight back to the bank.
On the third floor he had to slow down his pace, he was quite out of breath - the steps, just like the height of each floor, were much higher than they needed to be and he'd been told that the painter lived right up in the attic.
The air was also quite oppressive, there was no proper stairwell and the narrow steps were closed in by walls on both sides with no more than a small, high window here and there.
K followed them slowly, caught up with one of the girls who had stumbled and been left behind by the others, and asked her as they went up side by side, Is there a painter, Titorelli, who lives here?
She nodded and asked in reply,  What d'you want to see him for?
I want to have him paint my portrait, he said.
They still had not arrived at the top, however, when the painter up above them suddenly pulled the door wide open and, with a deep bow, invited K to enter.
The girls, on the other hand, he tried to keep away, he did not want to let any of them in however much they begged him and however much they tried to get in - if they could not get in with his permission they would try to force their way in against his will.
The only one to succeed was the hunchback when she slipped through under his outstretched arm, but the painter chased after her, grabbed her by the skirt, span her once round and set her down again by the door with the other girls who, unlike the first, had not dared to cross the doorstep while the painter had left his post.
One behind the other, the girls by the door stretched their necks up high and called out various words to the painter which were meant in jest but which K did not understand, and even the painter laughed as the hunchback whirled round in his hand.
Meanwhile, K had been looking round the room, if it had not been pointed out it would never have occurred to him that this wretched little room could be called a studio.
It was hardly long enough or broad enough to make two steps.
Behind K was the window through which the fog made it impossible to see further than the snow covered roof of the neighbouring building.
So he drew the manufacturer's letter out from his pocket, held it out to the painter and said, I learned about you from this gentleman, an acquaintance of yours, and it's on  his advice that I've come here.
The painter glanced through the letter and threw it down onto the bed.
If the manufacturer had not said very clearly that Titorelli was an acquaintance of his, a poor man who was dependent on his charity, then it would really have been quite possible to believe that Titorelli did not know him or at least that he could not remember him.
This impression was augmented by the painter's asking, Were you wanting to buy some pictures or did you want to have yourself painted?
K looked at the painter in astonishment.
What did the letter actually say?
K had taken it as a matter of course that the manufacturer had explained to the painter in his letter that K wanted nothing more with him than to find out more about his trial.
He had been far too rash in coming here!
But now he had to give the painter some sort of answer and, glancing at the easel, said, Are you working on a picture currently?
It's a portrait.
Quite a good piece of work, although it's not quite finished yet.
This was a convenient coincidence for K, it gave him a good opportunity to talk about the court as the picture showed, very clearly, a judge.
What's more, it was remarkably similar to the picture in the lawyer's office, although this one showed a quite different judge, a heavy man with a full beard which was black and bushy and extended to the sides far up the man's cheeks.
The lawyer's picture was also an oil painting, whereas this one had been made with pastel colours and was pale and unclear.
But everything else about the picture was similar, as this judge, too, was holding tightly to the arm of his throne and seemed ominously about to rise from it.
At first K was about to say, He certainly is a judge, but he held himself back for the time being and went closer to the picture as if he wanted to study it in detail.
There was a large figure shown in middle of the throne's back rest which K could not understand and asked the painter about it.
That'll need some more work done on it, the painter told him, and taking a pastel crayon from a small table he added a few strokes to the edges of the figure but without making it any clearer as far as K could make out.
That's the figure of justice, said the painter, finally.
Now I see, said K, here's the blindfold and here are the scales.
But aren't those wings on her heels, and isn't she moving?
Yes, said the painter, I had to paint it like that according to the contract.
It's actually the figure of justice and the goddess of victory all in one.
That is not a good combination, said K with a smile.
I'm just doing what the client wanted, said the painter.
Yes, certainly, said K, who had not meant to criticise anyone by that comment.
You've painted the figure as it actually appears on the throne.
No,  said the painter, I've never seen that figure or that throne, it's all just invention, but they told me what it was I had to paint.
I'm sorry about that, said the painter as he returned to K  K had hardly turned towards the door, he had left it completely up to the painter whether and how he would place him under his protection if he wanted to.
Even now, he made hardly any movement as the painter bent over him and, whispering into his ear in order not to be heard outside, said, These girls belong to the court as well.
The painter had pulled his seat closer to the bed and continued in a subdued voice: I forgot to ask you; what sort of acquittal is it you want?
Probably the only thing that could do that is if the accused is innocent.
In that case you won't need me or any other kind of help.
At first, K was astonished at this orderly explanation, but then, just as quietly as the painter, he said, I think you're contradicting yourself.
K had at last made the decision to withdraw his defence from the lawyer.
It was impossible to remove his doubts as to whether this was the right decision, but this was outweighed by his belief in its necessity.
This decision, on the day he intended to go to see the lawyer, took a lot of the strength he needed for his work, he worked exceptionally slowly, he had to remain in his office a long time, and it was already past ten o'clock when he finally stood in front of the lawyer's front door.
Even before he rang he considered whether it might not be better to give the lawyer notice by letter or telephone, a personal conversation would certainly be very difficult.
Nonetheless, K did not actually want to do without it, if he gave notice by any other means it would be received in silence or with a few formulated words, and unless Leni could discover anything K would never learn how the lawyer had taken his dismissal and what its consequences might be, in the lawyer's not unimportant opinion.
But sitting in front of him and taken by surprise by his dismissal, K would be able easily to infer everything he wanted from the lawyer's face and behaviour, even if he could not be induced to say very much.
It was not even out of the question that K might, after all, be persuaded that it would be best to leave his defence to the lawyer and withdraw his dismissal.
As usual, there was at first no response to K's ring at the door.
Leni could be a bit quicker, thought K  But he could at least be glad there was nobody else interfering as usually happened, be it the man in his nightshirt or anyone else who might bother him.
K watched her as she went; the decision had finally been made that the lawyer was to be dismissed, it was probably better that he had not been able to discuss the matter any more with Leni beforehand; she hardly understood the complexity of the matter, she would certainly have advised him against it and perhaps would even have prevented him from dismissing the lawyer this time, he would have remained in doubt and unease and eventually have carried out his decision after a while anyway as this decision was something he could not avoid.
The sooner it was carried out the more harm would be avoided.
And moreover, perhaps the businessman had something to say on the matter.
K turned round, the businessman hardly noticed it as he was about to stand up.
Stay where you are, said K and pulled up a chair beside him.
I've been waiting for you a very long time, said the lawyer from his bed.
He had been reading something by the light of a candle but now he laid it onto the bedside table and put his glasses on, looking at K sharply through them.
Instead of apologising K said, I'll be leaving again soon.
I find that quite acceptable, said K  The lawyer looked at him quizzically.
Sit down, he said.
As you wish, said K, drawing a chair up to the bedside table and sitting down.
It seemed to me that you locked the door, said the lawyer.
Yes, said K, it was because of Leni.
He had no intention of letting anyone off lightly.
But the lawyer asked him, Was she being importunate again?
Leni appeared almost the moment he had done so.
She looked hurriedly at K and the lawyer to try and find out what had happened; she seemed to be reassured by the sight of K sitting calmly at the lawyer's bed.
She smiled and nodded to K, K looked blankly back at her.
Fetch Block, said the lawyer.
To the lawyer!
Then, probably because the lawyer had turned his face to the wall and was paying no attention, she slipped in behind K's chair.
From then on, she bothered him by leaning forward over the back of the chair or, albeit very tenderly and carefully, she would run her hands through his hair and over his cheeks.
Block came as soon as he was called, but he remained standing in the doorway and seemed to be wondering whether he should enter or not.
He raised his eyebrows and lowered his head as if listening to find out whether the order to attend the lawyer would be repeated.
K could have encouraged to enter, but he had decided to make a final break not only with the lawyer but with everything in his home, so he kept himself motionless.
Leni was also silent.
Block noticed that at least no-one was chasing him away, and, on tiptoe, he entered the room, his face was tense, his hands were clenched behind his back.
He left the door open in case he needed to go back again.
K did not even glance at him, he looked instead only at the thick quilt under which the lawyer could not be seen as he had squeezed up very close to the wall.
This chapter was left unfinished.
A very important Italian business contact of the bank had come to visit the city for the first time and K was given the task of showing him some of its cultural sights.
At any other time he would have seen this job as an honour but now, when he was finding it hard even to maintain his current position in the bank, he accepted it only with reluctance.
Every hour that he could not be in the office was a cause of concern for him, he was no longer able to make use of his time in the office anything like as well as he had previously, he spent many hours merely pretending to do important work, but that only increased his anxiety about not being in the office.
Then he sometimes thought he saw the deputy director, who was always watching, come into K's office, sit at his desk, look through his papers, receive clients who had almost become old friends of K, and lure them away from him, perhaps he even discovered mistakes, mistakes that seemed to threaten K from a thousand directions when he was at work now, and which he could no longer avoid.
So now, if he was ever asked to leave the office on business or even needed to make a short business trip, however much an honour it seemed - and tasks of this sort happened to have increased substantially recently - there was always the suspicion that they wanted to get him out of his office for a while and check his work, or at least the idea that they thought he was dispensable.
It would not have been difficult for him to turn down most of these jobs, but he did not dare to do so because, if his fears had the slightest foundation, turning the jobs down would have been an acknowledgement of them.
For this reason, he never demurred from accepting them, and even when he was asked to go on a tiring business trip lasting two days he said nothing about having to go out in the rainy autumn weather when he had a severe chill, just in order to avoid the risk of not being asked to go.
When, with a raging headache, he arrived back from this trip he learned that he had been chosen to accompany the Italian business contact the following day.
The temptation for once to turn the job down was very great, especially as it had no direct connection with business, but there was no denying that social obligations towards this business contact were in themselves important enough, only not for K, who knew quite well that he needed some successes at work if he was to maintain his position there and that, if he failed in that, it would not help him even if this Italian somehow found him quite charming; he did not want to be removed from his workplace for even one day, as the fear of not being allowed back in was too great, he knew full well that the fear was exaggerated but it still made him anxious.
However, in this case it was almost impossible to think of an acceptable excuse, his knowledge of Italian was not great but still good enough; the deciding factor was that K had earlier known a little about art history and this had become widely known around the bank in extremely exaggerated form, and that K had been a member of the Society for the Preservation of City Monuments, albeit only for business reasons.
It was a very rainy and stormy morning when K, in a foul temper at the thought of the day ahead of him, arrived early at seven o'clock in the office so that he could at least do some work before his visitor would prevent him.
He had spent half the night studying a book of Italian grammar so that he would be somewhat prepared and was very tired; his desk was less attractive to him than the window where he had spent far too much time sitting of late, but he resisted the temptation and sat down to his work.
Unfortunately, just then the servitor came in and reported that the director had sent him to see whether the chief clerk was already in his office; if he was, then would he please be so kind as to come to his reception room as the gentleman from Italy was already there.
I'll come straight away, said K  He put a small dictionary in his pocket, took a guide to the city's tourist sites under his arm that he had compiled for strangers, and went through the deputy director's office into that of the director.
He was glad he had come into the office so early and was able to be of service immediately, nobody could seriously have expected that of him.
The deputy director's office was, of course, still as empty as the middle of the night, the servitor had probably been asked to summon him too but without success.
The director gave him a friendly smile, he was clearly very glad that K was there, he immediately introduced him to the Italian who shook K's hand vigorously and joked that somebody was an early riser.
K did not quite understand whom he had in mind, it was moreover an odd expression to use and it took K a little while to guess its meaning.
He replied with a few bland phrases which the Italian received once more with a laugh, passing his hand nervously and repeatedly over his blue-grey, bushy moustache.
When they had all sat down and begun a light preliminary conversation, K was disconcerted to notice that he understood no more than fragments of what the Italian said.
When he spoke very calmly he understood almost everything, but that was very infrequent, mostly the words gushed from his mouth and he seemed to be enjoying himself so much his head shook.
When he was talking in this way his speech was usually wrapped up in some kind of dialect which seemed to K to have nothing to do with Italian but which the director not only understood but also spoke, although K ought to have foreseen this as the Italian came from the south of his country where the director had also spent several years.
Whatever the cause, K realised that the possibility of communicating with the Italian had been largely taken from him, even his French was difficult to understand, and his moustache concealed the movements of his lips which might have offered some help in understanding what he said.
K began to anticipate many difficulties,  he gave up trying to understand what the Italian said - with the director there, who could understand him so easily, it would have been pointless effort - and for the time being did no more than scowl at the Italian as he relaxed sitting deep but comfortable in the armchair, as he frequently pulled at his short, sharply tailored jacket and at one time lifted his arms in the air and moved his hands freely to try and depict something that K could not grasp, even though he was leaning forward and did not let the hands out of his sight.
K had nothing to occupy himself but mechanically watch the exchange between the two men and his tiredness finally made itself felt, to his alarm, although fortunately in good time, he once caught himself nearly getting up, turning round and leaving.
Eventually the Italian looked at the clock and jumped up.
After taking his leave from the director he turned to K, pressing himself so close to him that K had to push his chair back just so that he could move.
The director had, no doubt, seen the anxiety in K's eyes as he tried to cope with this dialect of Italian, he joined in with this conversation in a way that was so adroit and unobtrusive that he seemed to be adding no more than minor comments, whereas in fact he was swiftly and patiently breaking into what the Italian said so that K could understand.
K learned in this way that the Italian first had a few business matters to settle, that he unfortunately had only a little time at his disposal, that he certainly did not intend to rush round to see every monument in the city, that he would much rather - at least as long as K would agree, it was entirely his decision  - just see the cathedral and to do so thoroughly.
He was extremely pleased to be accompanied by someone who was so learned and so pleasant - by this he meant K, who was occupied not with listening to the Italian but the director - and asked if he would be so kind, if the time was suitable, to meet him in the cathedral in two hours' time at about ten o'clock.
He hoped he would certainly be able to be there at that time.
K made an appropriate reply, the Italian shook first the director's hand and then K's, then the director's again and went to the door, half turned to the two men who followed him and continuing to talk without a break.
He thought he needed to apologise to K for something and told him - they were standing intimately close together - he had thought at first he would accompany the Italian himself, but then - he gave no more precise reason than this - then he decided it would be better to send K with him.
He should not be surprised if he could not understand the Italian at first, he would be able to very soon, and even if he really could not understand very much he said it was not so bad, as it was really not so important for the Italian to be understood.
And with that, it was time for K to go.
He spent the time still remaining to him with a dictionary, copying out obscure words he would need to guide the Italian round the cathedral.
It was an extremely irksome task, servitors brought him the mail, bank staff came with various queries and, when they saw that K was busy, stood by the door and did not go away until he had listened to them, the deputy director did not miss the opportunity to disturb K and came in frequently, took the dictionary from his hand and flicked through its pages, clearly for no purpose, when the door to the ante-room opened even clients would appear from the  half darkness and bow timidly to him - they wanted to attract his attention but were not sure whether he had seen them - all this activity was circling around K with him at its centre while he compiled the list of words he would need, then looked them up in the dictionary, then wrote them out, then practised their pronunciation and finally tried to learn them by heart.
The good intentions he had had earlier, though, seemed to have left him completely, it was the Italian who had caused him all this effort and sometimes he became so angry with him that he buried the dictionary under some papers firmly intending to do no more preparation, but then he realised he could not walk up and down in the cathedral with the Italian without saying a word, so, in an even greater rage, he pulled the dictionary back out again.
At exactly half past nine, just when he was about to leave, there was a telephone call for him, Leni wished him good morning and asked how he was, K thanked her hurriedly and told her it was impossible for him to talk now as he had to go to the cathedral.
By now the time was late and there was almost a danger he would not be on time.
He took a taxi to the cathedral, at the last moment he had remembered the album that he had had no opportunity to give to the Italian earlier and so took it with him now.
He held it on his knees and drummed impatiently on it during the whole journey.
The rain had eased off slightly but it was still damp chilly and dark, it would be difficult to see anything in the cathedral but standing about on cold flagstones might well make K's chill much worse.
The square in front of the cathedral was quite empty, K remembered how even as a small child he had noticed that nearly all the houses in this narrow square had the curtains at their windows closed most of the time, although today, with the weather like this, it was more understandable.
K hurried along both the side naves but saw no-one but an old woman who, wrapped up in a warm shawl, was kneeling at a picture of the Virgin Mary and staring up at it.
K went back to the main entrance, stood there indecisively for a while, and then walked round the cathedral in the rain in case the Italian was waiting at another entrance.
He was nowhere to be found.
Could the director have misunderstood what time they had agreed on?
How could anyone understand someone like that properly anyway?
Whatever had happened, K would have to wait for him for at least half an hour.
As he was tired he wanted to sit down, he went back inside the cathedral, he found something like a small carpet on one of the steps, he moved it with his foot to a nearby pew, wrapped himself up tighter in his coat, put the collar up and sat down.
To pass the time he opened the album and flicked through the pages a little but soon had to give up as it became so dark that when he looked up he could hardly make out anything in the side nave next to him.
In the distance there was a large triangle of candles flickering on the main altar, K was not certain whether he had seen them earlier.
Perhaps they had only just been lit.
Church staff creep silently as part of their job, you don't notice them.
It was all very pretty, but totally inadequate to illuminate the pictures which were usually left in the darkness of the side altars, and seemed to make the darkness all the deeper.
It was discourteous of the Italian not to come but it was also sensible of him, there would have been nothing to see, they would have had to content themselves with seeking out a few pictures with K's electric pocket torch and looking at them one small part at a time.
K went over to a nearby side chapel to see what they could have hoped for, he went up a few steps to a low marble railing and leant over it to look at the altar picture by the light of his torch.
The eternal light hung disturbingly in front of it.
The first thing that K partly saw and partly guessed at was a large knight in armour who was shown at the far edge of the painting.
He was leaning on his sword that he had stuck into the naked ground in front of him where only a few blades of grass grew here and there.
It was astonishing to see how he stood there without going any closer.
Perhaps it was his job to stand guard.
It was a long time since K had looked at any pictures and he studied the knight for a long time even though he had continually to blink as he found it difficult to bear the green light of his torch.
Then when he moved the light to the other parts of the picture he found an interment of Christ shown in the usual way, it was also a comparatively new painting.
He put his torch away and went back to his place.
There seemed to be no point in waiting for the Italian any longer, but outside it was certainly raining heavily, and as it was not so cold in the cathedral as K had expected he decided to stay there for the time being.
Close by him was the great pulpit, there were two plain golden crosses attached to its little round roof which were lying almost flat and whose tips crossed over each other.
The outside of the pulpit's balustrade was covered in green foliage which continued down to the column supporting it, little angels could be seen among the leaves, some of them lively and some of them still.
K walked up to the pulpit and examined it from all sides, its stonework had been sculpted with great care, it seemed as if the foliage had trapped a deep darkness between and behind its leaves and held it there prisoner, K lay his hand in one of these gaps and cautiously felt the stone, until then he had been totally unaware of this pulpit's existence.
When he entered the central nave to go back to where he had left the album, he noticed a small secondary pulpit on a column almost next to the stalls by the altar where the choir sat.
It was very simple, made of plain white stone, and so small that from a distance it looked like an empty niche where the statue of a saint ought to have been.
It certainly would have been impossible for the priest to take a full step back from the balustrade, and, although there was no decoration on it, the top of the pulpit curved in exceptionally low so that a man of average height would not be able stand upright and would have to remain bent forward over the balustrade.
In all, it looked as if it had been intended to make the priest suffer, it was impossible to understand why this pulpit would be needed as there were also the other ones available which were large and so artistically decorated.
And K would certainly not have noticed this little pulpit if there had not been a lamp fastened above it, which usually meant there was a sermon about to be given.
So was a sermon to be given now?
In this empty church?
But under the pulpit - K grinned in astonishment - there really was a priest standing with his hand on the handrail ready to climb the steps and looking at K  Then he nodded very slightly, so that K crossed himself and genuflected as he should have done earlier.
With a little swing, the priest went up into the pulpit with short fast steps.
Was there really a sermon about to begin?
Maybe the man in the cassock had not been really so demented, and had meant to lead K's way to the preacher, which in this empty church would have been very necessary.
And there was also, somewhere in front of a picture of the Virgin Mary, an old woman who should have come to hear the sermon.
And if there was to be a sermon why had it not been introduced on the organ?
K now considered whether he should leave as quickly as possible, if he did not do it now there would be no chance of doing so during the sermon and he would have to stay there for as long as it lasted, he had lost so much time when he should have been in his office, there had long been no need for him to wait for the Italian any longer, he looked at his watch, it was eleven.
But could there really be a sermon given?
Could K constitute the entire congregation?
How could he when he was just a stranger who wanted to look at the church?
That, basically, was all he was.
The priest - there was no doubt that he was a priest, a young man with a smooth, dark face - was clearly going up there just to put the lamp out after somebody had lit it by mistake.
But there had been no mistake, the priest seemed rather to check that the lamp was lit and turned it a little higher, then he slowly turned to face the front and leant down on the balustrade gripping its angular rail with both hands.
K had moved back a long way and leant his elbows on the front pew.
Somewhere in the church - he could not have said exactly where - he could make out the man in the cassock hunched under his bent back and at peace, as if his work were completed.
In the cathedral it was now very quiet!
But K would have to disturb that silence, he had no intention of staying there; if it was the priest's duty to preach at a certain time regardless of the circumstances then he could, and he could do it without K's taking part, and K's presence would do nothing to augment the effect of it.
So K began slowly to move, felt his way on tiptoe along the pew, arrived at the broad aisle and went along it without being disturbed, except for the sound of his steps, however light, which rang out on the stone floor and resounded from the vaulting, quiet but continuous at a repeating, regular pace.
K felt slightly abandoned as, probably observed by the priest, he walked by himself between the empty pews, and the size of the cathedral seemed to be just at the limit of what a man could bear.
When he arrived back at where he had been sitting he did not hesitate but simply reached out for the album he had left there and took it with him.
He had nearly left the area covered by pews and was close to the  empty space between himself and the exit when, for the first time, he heard the voice of the priest.
A powerful and experienced voice.
It pierced through the reaches of the cathedral ready waiting for it!
But the priest was not calling out to the congregation, his cry was quite unambiguous and there was no escape from it, he called Josef K!
K stood still and looked down at the floor.
In theory he was still free, he could have carried on walking, through one of three dark little wooden doors not far in front of him and away from there.
But if he once turned round he would be trapped, then he would have acknowledged that he had understood perfectly well, that he really was the Josef K the priest had called to and that he was willing to follow.
If the priest had called out again K would certainly have carried on out the door, but everything was silent as K also waited, he turned his head slightly as he wanted to see what the priest was doing now.
He did so, and the priest beckoned him with his finger.
As everything could now be done openly he ran - because of curiosity and the wish to get it over with - with long flying leaps towards the pulpit.
At the front pews he stopped, but to the priest he still seemed too far away, he reached out his hand and pointed sharply down with his finger to a place immediately in front of the pulpit.
Yes, said K, he considered how freely he had always given his name in the past, for some time now it had been a burden to him, now there were people who knew his name whom he had never seen before, it had been so nice first to introduce yourself and only then for people to know who you were.
You have been accused, said the priest, especially gently.
Yes, said K, so I have been informed.
Then you are the one I am looking for, said the priest.
I am the prison chaplain.
That is beside the point, said the priest.
What are you holding in your hand?
Is it a prayer book?
No, answered K, it's an album of the city's tourist sights.
Put it down, said the priest.
The two men, then, remained silent for a long time.
In the darkness beneath him, the priest could not possibly have seen K distinctly, although K was able to see him clearly by the light of the little lamp.
Why did the priest not come down?
He had not given a sermon, he had only told K a few things which, if he followed them closely, would probably cause him more harm than good.
But the priest certainly seemed to mean well, it might even be possible, if he would come down and cooperate with him, it might even be possible for him to obtain some acceptable piece of advice that could make all the difference, it might, for instance, be able to show him not so much to influence the proceedings but how to break free of them, how to evade them, how to live away from them.
K waited for him at the foot of the steps.
I told you the story exactly as it was written.
There's nothing in there about cheating.
He didn't ask him before that, said the priest, and don't forget he was only a doorkeeper, and as doorkeeper he did his duty.
K said that as if it were his final word but it was not his conclusion.
He was too tired to think about all the ramifications of the story, and the sort of thoughts they led him into were not familiar to him, unrealistic things, things better suited for officials of the court to discuss than for him.
The simple story had lost its shape, he wanted to shake it off, and the priest who now felt quite compassionate allowed this and accepted K's remarks without comment, even though his view was certainly very different from K's.
The lamp in his hand had long since gone out.
Once, just in front of him, he thought he could see the statue of a saint by the glitter of the silver on it, although it quickly disappeared back into the darkness.
No, said the priest, we're a long way from it.
Do you already want to go?
I'm the chief clerk in a bank and there are people waiting for me, I only came here to show a foreign business contact round the cathedral.
Alright, said the priest offering him his hand, go then.
But I can't find my way round in this darkness by myself, said K  Go to your left as far as the wall, said the priest, then continue alongside the wall without leaving it and you'll find a way out.
I'm waiting, said the priest.
The evening before K's thirty-first birthday - it was about nine o'clock in the evening, the time when the streets were quiet - two men came to where he lived.
After some brief formalities at the door of the flat when they first arrived, the same formalities were repeated at greater length at K's door.
He had not been notified they would be coming, but K sat in a chair near the door, dressed in black as they were, and slowly put on new gloves which stretched tightly over his fingers and behaved as if he were expecting visitors.
He immediately stood up and looked at the gentlemen inquisitively.
As soon as they were on the stairs the gentlemen wanted to take K's arms, but K said Wait till we're in the street, I'm not ill.
They kept their shoulders close behind his, did not turn their arms in but twisted them around the entire length of K's arms and took hold of his hands with a grasp that was formal, experienced and could not be resisted.
K was held stiff and upright between them, they formed now a single unit so that if any one of them had been knocked down all of them must have fallen.
Whenever they passed under a lamp K tried to see his companions more clearly, as far as was possible when they were pressed so close together, as in the dim light of his room this had been hardly possible.
Maybe they're tenors, he thought as he saw their big double chins.
The cleanliness of their faces disgusted him.
He could see the hands that cleaned them, passing over the corners of their eyes, rubbing at their upper lips, scratching out the creases on those chins.
When K noticed that, he stopped, which meant the others had to stop too; they were at the edge of an open square, devoid of people but decorated with flower beds.
Just then, Miss Bürstner came up into the square in front of them from the steps leading from a small street at a lower level.
But it did not matter to K whether it was certainly her anyway, he just became suddenly aware that there was no point in his resistance.
There would be nothing heroic about it if he resisted, if he now caused trouble for these gentlemen, if in defending himself he sought to enjoy his last glimmer of life.
Now they permitted him to decide which direction they took, and he decided to take the direction that followed the young woman in front of them, not so much because he wanted to catch up with her, nor even because he wanted to keep her in sight for as long as possible, but only so that he would not forget the reproach she represented for him.
The only thing I can do now, he said to himself, and his thought was confirmed by the equal length of his own steps with the steps of the two others, the only thing I can do now is keep my common sense and do what's needed right till the end.
That was wrong of me.
Should I now show them I learned nothing from facing trial for a year?
Should I go out like someone stupid?
Should I let anyone say, after I'm gone, that at the start of the proceedings I wanted to end them, and that now that they've ended I want to start them again?
I don't want anyone to say that.
I'm grateful they sent these unspeaking, uncomprehending men to go with me on this journey, and that it's been left up to me to say what's necessary.
Meanwhile, the young woman had turned off into a side street, but K could do without her now and let his companions lead him.
All three of them now, in complete agreement, went over a bridge in the light of the moon, the two gentlemen were willing to yield to each little movement made by K as he moved slightly towards the edge and directed the group in that direction as a single unit.
The moonlight glittered and quivered in the water, which divided itself around a small island covered in a densely-piled mass of foliage and trees and bushes.
Beneath them, now invisible, there were gravel paths with comfortable benches where K had stretched himself out on many summer's days.
Behind K's back one of them seemed to quietly criticise the other for the misunderstanding about stopping, and then they went on.
They went on up through several streets where policemen were walking or standing here and there; some in the distance and then some very close.
One of them with a bushy moustache, his hand on the  grip of his sword, seemed to have some purpose in approaching the group, which was hardly unsuspicious.
Several times he looked back cautiously to see if the policeman was following; but when they had a corner between themselves and the policeman K began to run, and the two gentlemen, despite being seriously short of breath, had to run with him.
In this way they quickly left the built up area and found themselves in the fields which, in this part of town, began almost without any transition zone.
Here the men stopped, perhaps because this had always been their destination or perhaps because they were too exhausted to run any further.
Here they released their hold on K, who just waited in silence, and took their top hats off while they looked round the quarry and wiped the sweat off their brows with their handkerchiefs.
After exchanging a few courtesies about who was to carry out the next tasks - the gentlemen did not seem to have been allocated specific functions - one of them went to K and took his coat, his waistcoat, and finally his shirt off him.
He did not want to expose K to the chilly night air without moving though, so he took him under the arm and walked up and down with him a little way while the other gentleman looked round the quarry for a suitable place.
When he had found it he made a sign and the other gentleman escorted him there.
It was near the rockface, there was a stone lying there that had broken loose.
Despite all the effort they went to, and despite all the co-operation shown by K, his demeanour seemed very forced and hard to believe.
So one of the gentlemen asked the other to grant him a short time while he put K in position by himself, but even that did nothing to make it better.
Then one of the gentlemen opened his frock coat and from a sheath hanging on a belt stretched across his waistcoat he withdrew a long, thin, double-edged butcher's knife which he held up in the light to test its sharpness.
The repulsive courtesies began once again, one of them passed the knife over K to the other, who then passed it back over K to the first.
He was not able to show his full worth, was not able to take all the work from the official bodies, he lacked the rest of the strength he needed and this final shortcoming was the fault of whoever had denied it to him.
As he looked round, he saw the top floor of the building next to the quarry.
He saw how a light flickered on and the two halves of a window opened out, somebody, made weak and thin by the height and the distance, leant suddenly far out from it and stretched his arms out even further.
Who was that?
A friend?
A good person?
Somebody who was taking part?
Somebody who wanted to help?
Was he alone?
Was it everyone?
Would anyone help?
Were there objections that had been forgotten?
There must have been some.
The logic cannot be refuted, but someone who wants to live will not resist it.
Where was the judge he'd never seen?
Where was the high court he had never reached?
He raised both hands and spread out all his fingers.
But the hands of one of the gentleman were laid on K's throat, while the other pushed the knife deep into his heart and twisted it there, twice.
