Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K, he knew he had done nothing wrong but, one morning, he was arrested.
Just as he got back in the adjoining room the door on the other side opened and Mrs Grubach was about to enter.
Because those two were sitting there in the next room and had taken his breakfast, perhaps?
Then he was so startled by a shout to him from the other room that he struck his teeth against the glass.
K knew very well that this room had recently been let to a typist called 'Miss Bürstner'.
And was he to learn nothing about the reasons for his arrest or those who were arresting him?
You want to see some point in it while you're carrying out something as pointless as it could be?
These gentlemen first accost me, and now they sit or stand about in here and let me be hauled up in front of you.
What point there would be, in telephoning a state attorney when I'm ostensibly under arrest?
immediately asked K, bringing his face close to the lad's, as it was hard to see in the half light of the landing.
I'm the landlord's son, sir, answered the lad, taking the pipe from his mouth and stepping to one side.
She was sat at the table with a knitted stocking and a pile of old stockings in front of her.
But now you must give me your hand, an agreement of this sort needs to be confirmed with a handshake.
The supervisor didn't shake hands, he thought, and looked at the woman differently from before, examining her.
Don't take it so hard, Mr K, she said, with tears in her voice and also, of course, forgetting the handshake.
No, said Mrs Grubach, smiling as she gave this simple piece of information, saying something sensible at last.
I'm afraid I don't know when she's coming in; she usually gets back late when she's been to the theatre.
Thank you, I'll take your word for it, said K, but went nonetheless over to the open door.
As far as could be seen, everything was indeed in its place, not even the blouse was hanging on the window handle.
The pillows on the bed looked remarkably plump as they lay half in the moonlight.
Miss Bürstner often comes home late, said K, looking at Mrs Grubach as if that were her responsibility.
Perhaps it would also still be possible, even if a little inappropriate, to have a few words with her.
Nothing would have been more nonsensical and, above all, more pointless and contemptible.
He could still make up for both of those things, though, if he went to the wine bar where Elsa worked.
It was already gone half past eleven when someone could be heard in the stairway.
Shivering, she pulled a silk shawl over her slender shoulders as she locked the door.
There was no time to lose, and in his helplessness he whispered through the crack of the door, Miss Bürstner.
There was a series of loud, curt and regular knocks at the door of the adjoining room.
He had hardly pulled himself together when he jumped over to Miss Bürstner and took her hand.
There is no reason for it, said K, and, now as she sank back onto the cushion, kissed her forehead.
Don't forget, he said, although this might be unpleasant for you you're not in any real danger.
What's more, she has borrowed a large sum of money from me and that makes her dependent on me.
Miss Bürstner looked at the floor in front of her, quiet and a little sunk in on herself.
K was informed by telephone that there would be a small hearing concerning his case the following Sunday.
For these reasons, it had been decided to hold a series of brief examinations following on one after another.
Sunday had been chosen as the day for the hearings so that K would not be disturbed in his professional work.
Cross-examinations could even be held in the night, for instance, but K would probably not be fresh enough at that time.
He dressed hurriedly, without the time to think and assemble the various plans he had worked out during the week.
And after all, he had no wish at all to humiliate himself before the committee by being too punctual.
Other windows were piled up with bedding, above which the dishevelled head of a woman would briefly appear.
People called out to each other across the street, one of the calls provoked a loud laugh about K himself.
Near him, there was a bare-footed man sitting on a crate and reading a newspaper.
Half grown girls, who seemed to be dressed in just their pinafores worked hardest running to and fro.
K knocked at the flats where the doors were closed and asked whether Lanz the joiner lived there.
Most of them were dressed in black, in old, long, formal frock coats that hung down loosely around them.
This second man was standing with his legs crossed and his elbows on the backrest of the chair, provoking much laughter.
From time to time he threw his arm in the air as if doing a caricature of someone.
The muttering also became immediately louder and, as the man said nothing more, died away only gradually.
Someone jumped down from the podium so that there would be a place free for K, and K stepped up onto it.
It was like an old school exercise book and had become quite misshapen from much thumbing.
He turned to K with the tone of someone who knows his facts and said, you are a house painter?
The people supported themselves with their hands on their knees and shook as if suffering a serious attack of coughing.
When K now began to speak he was convinced he was doing it in the same way as them.
You will be quite right, as there are proceedings only if I acknowledge that there are.
But, for the moment, I do acknowledge it, out of pity for yourselves to a large extent.
He had spoken sharply, more sharply than he had intended, but he had been quite right.
It was only the judge who gave K any direct pleasure, as he seemed to have been immediately struck by K's words.
Now, in the pause, he sat down very slowly, as if he did not want anyone to notice.
He took out the notebook again, probably so that he could give the impression of being calmer.
That won't help you, sir, continued K, even your little book will only confirm what I say.
Those are the official notes of the examining judge, he said, and let the notebook fall down onto the desk.
Could they perhaps be the crucial group who could turn the whole assembly one way or the other?
Somewhere in the hall, someone raised his hands and applauded him shouting, Bravo!
Some of the men in the first row groped around in their beards, none of them looked round to see who was shouting.
I'm not trying to be a successful orator, said K after this thought, that's probably more than I'm capable of anyway.
I'm sure the examining judge can speak far better than I can, it is part of his job after all.
I can see him now, sitting on the chair belonging to that lady I mentioned - a picture of dull-witted arrogance.
As he did so he thought he saw the judge use a movement of his eyes to give a sign to someone in the crowd.
K smiled and said, And now the judge, right next to me, is giving a secret sign to someone among you.
Whether it was embarrassment or impatience, the judge rocked backwards and forwards on his seat.
The replies they received were just as quiet, and given behind the protection of a raised hand.
There was immediate silence, which showed how well K was in control of the crowd.
There is no doubt, he said quietly, that there is some enormous organisation determining what is said by this court.
How are we to avoid those in office becoming deeply corrupt when everything is devoid of meaning?
That is impossible, not even the highest judge would be able to achieve that for himself.
It was the washerwoman whom K had recognised as a likely source of disturbance as soon as she had entered.
K could only see that a man had pulled her into a corner by the door and was pressing himself against her.
But it was not her who was screaming, but the man, he had opened his mouth wide and looked up at the ceiling.
However, the examining judge seems to have moved even more quickly than K, as he was waiting for him at the doorway.
K stood where he was, but looked at the door with his hand already on its handle rather than at the judge.
Was he not still free, so free that he could crush the entire court whenever he wanted, as least where it concerned him?
In fact you should have gone, you should have left as quickly as possible as soon as I got here.
I'm sure you'll still have a lot of study to do before you're made into a judge.
You're wasting your breath, said K, then he reached his hand out towards the woman and said, come with me.
What a position it was that K found himself in, compared with the judge sitting up in the attic!
They don't show any concern at all, said the usher, just look at the waiting room here.
It consisted of a long corridor from which roughly made doors led out to the separate departments of the attic.
They sat, equally spaced, on two rows of long wooden benches which had been placed along both sides of the corridor.
None of them stood properly upright, their backs were bowed, their knees bent, they stood like beggars on the street.
Yes, said the usher, they are the accused, everyone you see here has been accused.
He asked the usher whether that was the right way to go, the usher nodded, and that is the way that K went.
In order to put an end to his discomfort, K finally said, Now that I've seen what it looks like here, I'd like to go.
I don't want to see everything, said K, who was also feeling very tired, I want to go, what is the way to the exit?
K sat down immediately and, in order to keep his place better, put his elbows on the armrests.
For some time after this, K found it impossible to exchange even just a few words with Miss Bürstner.
He tried to reach her in many and various ways but she always found a way to avoid it.
If the maid went by and closed the door of the apparently empty room he would get up after a while and open it again.
Now don't cry, he said again as he turned his look back into the room where Mrs Grubach was still crying.
Mrs Grubach pulled her apron down to below her eyes to see whether K really was attempting a reconciliation.
I kept asking myself why it was that Mr K took such an interest in Miss Bürstner.
Why does he quarrel with me over her when he knows that any cross word from him and I can't sleep that night?
And I didn't say anything about Miss Bürstner that I hadn't seen with my own eyes.
He contented himself with merely drinking his coffee and letting Mrs Grubach feel that she was superfluous.
Outside, the dragging steps of Miss Montag could still be heard as she went from one side of the hallway to the other.
As he went through the hallway he looked at the closed door of Miss Bürstner's room.
But it wasn't there that he was invited, but the dining room, to which he yanked the door open without knocking.
When K entered, Miss Montag came towards him from the window along one side of the table.
Then Miss Montag, her head unusually erect as always, said, I'm not sure whether you know me.
Of course I do, he said, you've been living here with Mrs Grubach for quite some time now.
But I get the impression you don't pay much attention to what's going on in the lodging house,  said Miss Montag.
He stood in amazement and listened again to establish whether he might not be mistaken.
But in the cupboard-like room itself stood three men, crouching under the low ceiling.
The two policemen were entirely at the whip-man's mercy; he could have beaten them to death.
On the way home, as he passed by the junk room again, he opened its door as if that had been his habit.
Everything was exactly the same as he had seen it when he had opened the door the previous evening.
K slammed the door immediately shut, and even thumped on it with his fists as if that would shut it all the firmer.
Almost in tears, he ran to the servitors working quietly at the copying machine.
It is necessary, he said with a tired gulp, it is necessary for my peace of mind.
K immediately sent the junior staff from the room and told them to let no-one in.
There was then a noise that everyone heard from the hallway as if something of porcelain were being broken.
I'll go and see what's happened, said K, who slowly left the room as if giving the others the chance to stop him.
Nothing has happened, she whispered to him, I just threw a plate against the wall to get you out of there.
A few steps along, they came to a frosted glass door which the carer opened for him.
This way, said the carer, pointing to a dark trunk with a carved, wooden backrest.
K thought he could see the little steps with which visitors would approach the massive desk.
I did think, she said you would come out here to me by yourself without me having to call you first.
And you ought to call me Leni, too, she added quickly and suddenly, as if no moment of this conversation should be lost.
He had often wondered whether it might not be a good idea to work out a written defence and hand it in to the court.
K had the feeling that he would be able to ask all the questions needed here himself.
Now and then he would give K some vague warning of the sort you give to children.
Conditions like this, of course, place the defence in a very unfavourable and difficult position.
This is because proceedings are generally kept secret not only from the public but also from the accused.
Only as far as that is possible, of course, but it is possible to a very large extent.
There are, of course, not many lawyers who can do this, and K has made a very good choice in this matter.
Huld, but they don't bother with the company of the lawyers' room and have nothing to do with it.
But they're not in an easy position, to regard their positions as easy would be to do them an injustice.
It's both difficult and hard at the same time to deal with them, and there's hardly any reason for it.
And even that is a kind of self- confidence, but then it's the only one that's left.
But there was still plenty of opportunity for lawyers to get to work, and K could be sure they would be made use of.
There was always some progress, but he could never be told what sort of progress it was.
K could not tell, but it seemed clear to him that his defence was not in good hands.
But it was still suspicious how he continually mentioned his personal contacts with the civil servants.
But when K had the confidence to try and do all this the difficulty of composing the documents was too much for him.
K now had no more thoughts of shame, the documents had to be prepared and submitted.
If, as was very likely, he could find no time to do it in the office he would have to do it at home at night.
Above all, he could not stop half way, that was nonsense not only in business but always and everywhere.
It would have been more suitable as a way of passing the long days after he had retired and become senile.
Almost involuntarily, only to put an end to it, his finger felt for the button of the electric bell in the ante-room.
But the time had, nonetheless, not been wasted, he had come to some decisions that could be of value.
He need not have worried, the two gentlemen met each other, shook each other's hand and went together over to K's desk.
The decision to take his defence into his own hands now seemed more of a burden than he had originally assumed.
How could he have sat there totally convinced of the need to do his own defence?
Was he supposed to let people in to see him and go into negotiations with them at a time like this?
And is it likely that anyone in the bank, when judging his work, would take any account of his peculiar situation?
There were those who knew about his trial, although it was not quite clear who knew about it or how much.
For no particular reason, just to avoiding returning to his desk for a while, he opened the window.
Chief clerk, said the manufacturer, I expect the weather's been affecting your mood, has it?
Yes, said K, raising his hand and holding the temple of his head, headaches, worries in the family.
K stepped back and immediately exclaimed, That's what the deputy director's been telling you!
It was all he could manage to give the manufacturer, who was already on his way to the door, a few words of thanks.
And it's not always a good idea to send letters to people like Titorelli, you don't know what might happen to them.
But you're bound to have thought everything through and you know what you can and can't do.
But it was only the manufacturer's comment that made K realise what dangers that could lead to.
The difficulties he had been feeling in carrying out his office work; were they now going to affect the trial too?
The deputy director seemed very good at appropriating everything that K was now forced to give up!
As K, somewhat agitated, approached the door the deputy director called out, Oh, you've still not left!
I'm looking for a copy of a contract, he said, which this gentleman  insists you must have.
Even if he had just some tiny success here it would still have a good effect on his work at the bank for that day.
Just as K paused for a while some young girls ran out of one of the flats and rushed higher up the stairs, laughing.
The girl, hardly thirteen years old and somewhat hunchbacked, jabbed him with her elbow and looked at him sideways.
Her youth and her bodily defects had done nothing to stop her being already quite depraved.
She did not smile once, but looked at K earnestly, with sharp, acquisitive eyes.
K pretended not to notice her behaviour and asked, Do you know Titorelli, the painter?
K thought it would be to his advantage quickly to find out something more about Titorelli.
K did not know what he was to make of all this, as they all seemed to be having fun.
Then he shut the door, bowed once more to K, offered him his hand and introduced himself, saying, Titorelli, painter.
K pointed to the door, behind which the girls were whispering, and said, You seem to be very popular in this building.
Everything, floor, walls and ceiling, was made of wood, between the planks narrow gaps could be seen.
Across from where K was, the bed stood against the wall under a covering of many different colours.
In the middle of the room a picture stood on an easel, covered over with a shirt whose arms dangled down to the ground.
The turning of the key in the lock reminded K that he had not wanted to stay too long.
Yes, said the painter, and he took the shirt hanging over the easel and threw it onto the bed after the letter.
Justice needs to remain still, otherwise the scales will move about and it won't be possible to make a just verdict.
One of the girls behind the door started up again, and asked, Titorelli, is he going to go soon?
There are three possibilities; absolute acquittal, apparent acquittal and deferment.
Absolute acquittal is the best, of course, only there's nothing I could do to get that sort of outcome.
I don't think there's anyone at all who could do anything to get an absolute acquittal.
As you are innocent it could actually be possible and you could depend on your innocence alone.
As K pressed on the button for the second time he looked back at the other door, but this time it, too, remained closed.
At last, two eyes appeared at the spy-hatch in the lawyer's door, although they weren't Leni's eyes.
As he had not apologised the lawyer ignored what K said, and replied, I won't let you in this late again next time.
But instead of going to fetch him, Leni just went to the door and called out, Block!
K eventually tried to stop her by taking hold of one hand, and after some resistance Leni let him keep hold of it.
It was said that this Italian was an art lover, so the choice of K to accompany him was a matter of course.
As K entered the reception room two men stood up from the deep armchairs where they had been sitting.
This moustache was obviously perfumed, it was almost tempting to come close to it and sniff.
K remained together with the director for a short while, although the director looked especially unhappy today.
And anyway, K's knowledge of Italian was surprisingly good, the director was sure he would get by very well.
The cathedral also seemed quite empty, of course no-one would think of going there on a day like this.
Then, in the distance, he saw a church official who limped away through a doorway in the wall.
K had arrived on time, it had struck ten just as he was entering the building, but the Italian still was not there.
When K happened to turn round he also saw a tall, stout candle attached to a column not far behind him.
He seemed to be paying close attention to something that was being played out in front of him.
K looked down at the steps which, pressed close against the column, led up to the pulpit.
They were so narrow they seemed to be there as decoration on the column rather than for anyone to use.
But the organ remained quiet and merely looked out weakly from the darkness of its great height.
The idea of a sermon, now, at eleven o'clock, on a workday, in hideous weather, was nonsense.
He stood there like that for a while and, without turning his head, looked around.
It would simply mean he had not understood, or that he had understood but chose not to pay attention to it.
He was merely standing in the pulpit as before, but it was obvious that he had seen K turn his head.
If K did not now turn round completely it would have been like a child playing hide and seek.
And K did as he was told, standing in that place he had to bend his head a long way back just to see the priest.
You are Josef K, said the priest, and raised his hand from the balustrade to make a gesture whose meaning was unclear.
I see, said K  I had you summoned here, said the priest, because I wanted to speak to you.
I knew nothing of that, said K  I came here to show the cathedral to a gentleman from Italy.
K threw it away with such force that it flapped open and rolled across the floor, tearing its pages.
K had to admit that this was something he had had on his mind quite a lot of late.
While he was still on one of the higher steps as he  came down them the priest reached out his hand for K to shake.
So the doorkeeper cheated the man, said K immediately, who had been captivated by the story.
Don't be too quick, said the priest, don't take somebody else's opinion without checking it.
But it's quite clear, said K, and your first interpretation of it was quite correct.
The doorkeeper gave him the information that would release him only when it could be of no more use.
In silence, they carried on walking for some time, K stayed close beside the priest without knowing where he was.
So that he would not remain entirely dependent on the priest, K asked him, We're now near the main entrance, are we?
K had not thought of going until then, but he immediately said, Yes, certainly, I have to go.
The priest had only gone a few paces from him, but K was already shouting loudly, Please, wait!
In frock coats, pale and fat, wearing top hats that looked like they could not be taken off their heads.
But they waited only until the front door before they took his arms in a way that K had never experienced before.
They formed a unit of the sort that normally can be formed only by matter that is lifeless.
It was not certain that it was her, although the similarity was, of course, great.
He started walking, which pleased the gentlemen and some of their pleasure conveyed itself to him.
I always wanted to go at the world and try and do too much, and even to do it for something that was not too cheap.
I didn't actually want to stop here, he said to his companions, shamed by their compliance with his wishes.
The two gentlemen stopped, the policeman seemed about to open his mouth, and then K drove his group forcefully forward.
There was a quarry, empty and abandoned, near a building which was still like those in the city.
The moonlight lay everywhere with the natural peace that is granted to no other light.
K made an involuntary shiver, at which the gentleman gave him a gentle, reassuring tap on the back.
Then he carefully folded the things up as if they would still be needed, even if not in the near future.
The gentlemen sat K down on the ground, leant him against the stone and settled his head down on the top of it.
In the end they left K in a position that was far from the best of the ones they had tried so far.
K now knew it would be his duty to take the knife as it passed from hand to hand above him and thrust it into himself.
But he did not do it, instead he twisted his neck, which was still free, and looked around.
As his eyesight failed, K saw the two gentlemen cheek by cheek, close in front of his face, watching the result.
